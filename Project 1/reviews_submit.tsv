		A3OHYJVBE4XZPE	Versatile addition to kitchen favorites	I use this syrup in tea, coffee and over cut up fruit and ice cream.I buy unflavored creamer and add this to it. Much cheaper alternative to pre-flavored coffee creamer.	0	0
		AKALDNM2XMFB1	My Daily Brew	This coffee is phenomenal for the taste and value. I'm on subscribe and save and this is my daily brew, I typically go though 2 lbs a month or so. This coffee has an excellent flavor and is not bitter or spicy, beats Starbucks breakfast blend hands down.	0	0
		AB29IDVYAYDL	Wonderful coffee	Love this coffee, but cannot buy it through regular outlets, so am gouged by SASA Corner. Really sticks in my craw paying more than a buck a cup.	0	0
		A2EZW502SEA2N9	Newman's Own Organics Dog Food	I cannot express enough how pleased I am with this dog food. I feed my 11 year old German Shepard, and my two year old Pittie Girl this food every day, and the benefits are astounding.  For most of my Shepards life I fed her a well known, vet recommended food, and yet she always had stomach problems.  Trying many things, it was not until I rescued, and I should really say she rescued me, and the dog food recall, that I began doing research on brands of food.  After a long investigation, I decided on Newman's Own, not only because there had been no recall on the food, but because of the ingredients, and that the proceeds going to charity. Now, choosing this brand, would mean that I would have to order it online, because my local stores did not carry it, but that was all right with me, because not only do I enjoy online ordering, but I am an older, disabled woman, and getting to the store and hauling in packages is very hard for me.  Well, I want to tell you, My 11 year old thrives on this food, with no more digestive issues, and a beautiful white coat, and she loves eating it with vigor. My two year old American Pit Bull Terrier, another love of my life, also thrives on this food, has the most beautiful shiny coat ever, and people say all the time how beautiful her coat is.  I do spoil my fur kids, but their health and well being is my number one priority.  I have just recently switched over feeding my 4 cats Newman's Own cat food, both dry and canned food, and since then, I have noticed the difference in the elimination of hair balls.  I know that I am truly a pet lover, but I believe that if you love your pets and want only the best well being for them, unnecessary medical issues, and all around good health, a good balanced, safe, natural food is the way to go.  I highly recommend Newman's Own dog and cat food.  I also feed my two dogs Newman's Own biscuits as treats.	88	1
		A1N5QQGTAZBOD3	Great Coffee, Great Prices, and Great Service!	I have purchased green coffee beans from several local and internet providers often with poor results.  U-Roast-Em is the exception. I have never had bad service with this company and now purchase all of my coffee from them.  They provide an excellent selection of high quality beans at great prices.  They do a great job with packaging and shipping!  Most of my orders have shipped the same day I ordered.<br /><br />I have tried most of their coffees and have yet to be disappointed.  If you are looking for a good mid priced coffee I would recommend La Minita Tarrazu de Costa Rica.<br /><br />I highly recommend you check out U-Roast-Em for all your coffee needs!	3	1
		A2F36VSJ4TED0U	It's Baking Soda	Okay so I bought this product and then had to laugh upon further research discovering that ALL baking soda is aluminum free.  It's baking POWDER that has aluminum in it.  The cheapest baking soda you can find is still aluminum free.  It's still good baking soda though, and kudos to the Bob's Red Mill marketing department.  You guys are geniuses.	3	0
		A3BH63GKL7MQ2K	Really, just bubbles and vitamin C	"The product description says that it's ""just juice, bubbles and vitamin C."" Really, it's just the last two. It's not entirely flavorless, but I've tasted plenty of beverages that are much better than this one with a lot less carbonation.<br /><br />And, honestly, this ""healthy"" drink is rather easily replaced by a multivitamin pill. It's not really good for you, it's just not directly bad for you. Sincerely, I'm fairly sure that sucking on my couch cushions would garner you more nutrition than a Mountain Dew, so it's not like ""better than soda"" is really setting the bar high.<br /><br />Rather disappointing, particularly compared to the other Switch beverages."	0	0
		A5D06XJHDXK75	Baci's are pure heaven - great gift, stocking stuffer!	"My family has been in love with Baci's ever since we lived in Europe.  When my daughters were small they coined the term ""Baci Pill"" for whenever they were hurt or not feeling well.  They are a wonderful treat, after a meal with espresso or cappuccino.  Pop the entire Baci in your mouth and experience the famous Perugina chocolate and then the still crunchy hazelnut center.  The Italians do everything with class and this beats a Hershey's Kiss any day!"	1	0

		AS0MJOXBZNO79	RIP OFF	"Initially I was so excited to find this gift basket - it ""seemed"" perfect for a reasonable price.  I received the product today and was terribly disappointed when seeing it.  Honestly  it looks like yunk that you MIGHT buy for $12 to $15 but CERTAINLY NOT $50!!  I will be sending this back ASAP and recommend that others do not waste their time and money on this cheap, tacky product."	3	0
		A22SSWTC8FQ0LG	Best coffee!	If you have a coffee grinder, this is the best coffee, I would highly recommend it! The taste and aroma remind me of sitting in a cafe in Holland, relaxing and watching the passersby...	0	0
		AEWOXA1CUTMDV	My dogs love these	I have two indoor small dogs, Poodle and Maltese, and they have high anxiety, especially my maltese and these seem to help! Even if it doesnt they sure love 'em. My maltese before he ate it set it down and rolled all over it, I think he likes it! I'd give it 5 stars but its just a little pricey.	0	0
		A24EK4IERC56NP	Not as good as regular	I couldn't really taste the bergamot in this tea.  It had more of a slight orange peel taste.  Since it is organic, I expected a cleaner, richer taste. It's OK, but not as good as the regular Twinings Earl Grey.  I have had other brands of organic that were superior to either of the Twinings, but at a much higher price.	1	0
		A36RJG7HHV45TQ	Didn't like the taste	With both a stomach problem and a love of coffee, I thought this would be a great solution. I was wrong. I just didn't care for the taste. I recommend trying some low acid coffee once somewhere you can get a small cup before purchasing a 10-pack of bags for home brew. :(	1	0
		A2E58SOV509OGK	Great Cookies	Didn't have time to make these this year so I thought I would buy them. I never buy cookies, but these I would buy again. My son loved them. The only thing I had to do was dip them in white chocolate.<br />Thanks	0	0
		A3R2412NO3M6EP	horrible taste	This stuff tastes like the pink soap in a a gas station bathroom smells.<br /><br />Yuck.<br /><br />I threw the whole bottle away after two tastes.  I only took the second taste to see if it really tasted as bad as it did.	3	3
		A3VPFEBA8VWJ5B	Love it!	I love this coffee!!  I had always mixed my decaf and regular to get 1/2 caffeine and now I can just buy it!!  Perfect amount for me. I enjoy the flavor of coffee!<br /><br />These vacuum sucked packages make it easy to store and use. It keeps the coffee fresh!!  I use then to refill another container and it works well for me!!	1	0
		A1NP2GLYFXFGUN	Not a success	We have three large dogs.  One of our English Pointers has trouble with periodontal disease.  Bright Bites are recommended by VOHC, so decided to give them a try.  I bought the spearmint and the cinnamon flavors.  Our Greyhound will eat them, but neither of our Pointers will even touch them.  For me, the expensive dental treats are a waste.<br />AL	0	0
		A3U7LZDJ6ZF3AU	Great food, but don't buy it here.	The food is great, but the bag that I got from amazon seemed very stale - half of it was smashed to powder, and you can get a better pricess elsewhere.	6	4
		A7K55EQ7IVBFC	Disappointed	We have ordered this coffee on several occasions and have been happy with the it.  The most recent order seemed lacking in quality.  It was bitter and disappointing.	0	0
		AXLEXZ750G5SE	Bought at my local supermarket	I found this in the organic aisle at my local supermarket.  $[...] for one box of 100 opposed to 3 boxes being sold here with no shipping or waiting.  I would just like to know if anyone knows if this is a good quality for being a bagged tea.  I'm not a Pu-erh expert and I am looking for something as authentic as I can get without paying an arm and a leg.  Can anyone suggest a good quality??  The only reason I gave this a 3 is because it is something you can find at your supermarket without buying a pack of 3.	0	4
		AGV7RC5IAOQP0	Not a good batch	"I wonder if I got a bad batch?  I go these with the ""Gold Box"" deal they have going.  Maybe they're not quite as fresh, been around in the warehouse too long or something?  Because these were not near as good as the other Virginia Peanuts I've had or ordered from Amazon in the past.  The ""Royal Oak"" in the blue can is what I got last time and they were much larger, not broken, crunchier, and just better tasting.  Seemed silly to return 2/3 of the order, and they are not really awful, completly fine actually, but my expectations were for a premium product. Fairly decent peanut, but these are suposed to be the best.  They were not.  Going to order the Royal Oak next time."	1	0
		A1T4L0Q47OZ9N	Great for stomach problems!	My shepherd/collie mix has IBS.  Our vet recommended a limited ingredient food.  This has really helped her symptoms and she likes it.  I will always buy it from Amazon...it's $10 cheaper and free shipping!	1	0
		A1RR16ALGFVC3A	Mushy. Yucky	Tried these the other day because of the low price and regreted it from the moment the jar was opened. These sausages tasted like card board soaked in beef flavored vinegar. Im used to eating Glazier's pickled sausages that snap when you bite them. Guess I will stick to what I like.	0	1
		A3ARZW7S96SESC	HORRIBLE I CANT BELIEVE THIS!	Terrible! I cannot believe this, I received this item and EVERY SINGLE BAG WAS OPENED BUT 4!!!! I'm stationed in Afghanistan and this was gonna be a snack for my team while going out on missions. I was so embarrassed when the bags were opened and spilt out all in the box, gross! And the box is filled with grease stains. Idk if it was from the airplane ride all the way here, but the box should have been more insulated and bubble wrap should have been used instead of paper. I'm very unhappy with stale crusty chips out the bag and us soldiers cannot enjoy now.	2	0
		AFZPOIV5W5JY	Great Alternative to Fried	These chips are flavorful without all the fat of fried. I love love the bbq flavor.  I also like how the chips don't crumble in the bag.	0	0
		A1RJSKLAE0WSDE	Christmas treat	I purchased this for Christmas 2011.  I love peppermint bark and like to try a new kind every year.  Its a very special yearly treat for me, so I expect a lot from the product.<br /><br />Pros for Scott's Cakes version:  Good organization and logistics:  the package arrived quickly, the candy was well wrapped in the shipping box and shrink-wrapped in a box of its own.  Candy was in good condition (i.e., no broken pieces) and fresh.<br /><br />This seller's peppermint bark achieves a nice mix of peppermint and white chocolate flavor.  White chocolate gives off a nice mellow tone; it is good quality.  There is no dark chocolate layer to upset the balance of peppermint and white chocolate flavors in one's mouth.  This attracted me to Scott's Cakes.<br /><br />Cons:  The quality of the peppermint pieces in the chocolate was very disappointing.  The ad mentions that the buyer should expect to see pieces of candy cane/peppermint starlight mints mixed with white chocolate.  The photo seems to support this claim, showing robustly sized pieces of candy cane in the bark.  I expected a very crunchy chewing experience, which I think is the hallmark of the best types of peppermint bark.  However, the pieces of peppermint candy are in reality very small; there is no sensation of crispness when taking a bite.  The peppermint candy has a chewy consistency, making it seem more like taffy.  Thus, there is no auditory pleasure in consuming this version of peppermint bark.	1	0
		A26ERUB0VE1IO4	great	These r great, only problem is easy to burn. Needs close attention while cooking. Follow the directions!! I only needed to cook these for one minute in my microwave.	0	0
		A3NQ57QHHLN2O6	36g of sugar still there!	If you think this is going to be a healthy product, you are sadly mistaken. It still contains 36g of sugar per can!  If you want to end up a fat diabetic, by all means, try it. Otherwise, try the ZERO CALORIE, ZERO SUGAR, ZERO CHEMICAL naturally fruit flavored seltzers like those by La Croix.	1	1
		A29R0R2UT7O16T	VERY HAPPY WITH THIS CAYENNE!!!	THIS SELLER WAS GREAT!!!RECIEVED MY ORDER IN ABOUT 4 DAYS!!! THE CAYENNE IS GREAT!!!NICE FLAVOR AND HOT JUST THE WAY I LIKE IT!!! wILL BE BACK FOR MORE AFTER THE 2LBS ARE GONE!!! THANKS FOR A GREAT PRODUCT AT A GOOD PRICE!!!	1	1
		A14EEBPOJP2VPZ	Eh.	Chewy Lemonhead and Friends are my favorite candy. Period. I love them...so much.<br />...(cough)<br />So when I found these I was really excited and bought a pack hoping they'd have that same tartness that makes Lemonhead and Friends so good!<br />Nope. Tasted just like every other jelly-gummy type candy. I was very let down. It was okay for jelly/gummy, but don't expect much.	1	0
		ALYF3U1ERAREB	"Great alternative to ""science diet"" allegry diets"	I have a dog with severe allergies we have been fighting for years. The vets always recommend mass produced allergy formulas like science diet.  I can't stomach feeding my dog that type of garbage. But simple is a good alternative, made with quality ingredients and the dogs love it too.  Great product!!	0	0

		AKHNCFO09GOG7	boring boring boring	"Reading in earlier reviews that these were genuine chinese fortunes, I served them with a chinese Christmas dinner and was greatly disappointed, as were my guests.  Three sample fortunes are:  ""Life is not a struggle.  It's a wiggle.""  ""Management is doing things right: leadership is doing the right things.""  ""If you're feeling down, try throwing yourself into your work.""  These are not fortunes, they are self-help mini-bites.  A fortune is:  ""Your love of travel will soon be satisfied,"" and it doesn't matter if they are predictive or not.  What matters is that they state a fortune.  ""Beware the dog in the corner house,"" would be fun to get.  ""Life is a wiggle"" is boring.<br />The cookies arrived on schedule, as promised, and in good condition in their individual wrappers.  All of that was as I'd hoped.  But content counts, in fortune cookies especially."	2	1
		A3UD2RQCVBAJJG	Don't Buy	This toy did not last. I have a boxer and he chewed the rope off the jar.	0	2
		A2PGOJFX4F8J3Y	It's cool but no miracle	"Before I bought this product I read several reviews saying that this stuff was amazing, that it made everything super sweet. So I thought I would try it out, and it is pretty cool, but not worth the outrageous price. About one minute after I sucked the tab I tried eating numerous things like limes, lemons, and oranges, just to name a few. It did make everything that's sour sweet. Not to the point of ""oh my god, it's amazing"" but it did work. So to sum this up, this stuff was good for a one time deal, but after doing it a few times it lost it's appeal."	2	0
		A1D0IH4JLVH2PC	No Good!	Tart, bitter aftertaste, horrible diet rootbeer!  It makes me feel bad drinking this and I probably won't ever buy this brand name again.	3	2
		A3KIS7K5BFFZ4B	crackers	Great alternative for those who can't eat wheat. A little bland, but crunchy and crispy.	2	0
		A23HRTD9I9K90Z	Smells like pipe tobacco to me	It's distracting to drink something that smells like pipe tobacco, so I am not giving this product a high personal rating. Also, I like my fruit drinks more authentic, with fewer mystery ingredients and preservatives added. This product is so well preserved, they recommend keeping it in the refrigerator, not the freezer.	0	0
		ANTWFMQSZLEJF	Dents in 2 of the tins when arrived	This cocoa is like any other cocoa, other than it is white and turns pink when touches liquid.  The tin is cute, but 2 cans were dented when they arrived. Not sure if it was from shipping or the seller.  A bit over priced in my opinion as well.	0	1
		A28X47RPHH0H8T	My dog won't take it!!!	After reading so many positive reviews, I have really high hope on this products. My 3 year old Shihtzu has been taking Greenies and since it costs significantly higher, I thought I can replace it with C.E.T. But sadly, he won't eat it at all. He simply sniffed at it and then walked away. I've tried in several occasions and I am now giving up and am giving it to neighbor's dog. I do have to note that my dog is a very picky eater. Hence my suggestion: If yours is also a picker on food, then try to get a sample or buy a smaller pack first before getting a large bag like I did.	1	0
		A2P0J7P4Y07TNC	Tastes great, but deceptive labeling	I've used this particular brand of 'white truffle oil' to make truffle butter for my steaks.  I have also drizzled over popcorn for an amazingly new taste.  So if you love the smell of truffles, then you'll probably like this product.<br /><br />My gripe is with the labeling.  It makes it seem as if real truffles are somehow involved with this product, they are not.  If you look at the ingredients, there are two:  olive oil and white truffle aroma.  Well truffle aroma is just 2,4-Dithiapentane.  You are buying 'perfumed' olive oil that smells like truffles, or at least what most of us have been lead to believe truffles smell like.  So buyer beware, it tastes and smells great, but this is not a real truffle product.	7	1
		A2PU80LCKRMC9X	Will not buy again...	I didn't like this coffee. It did have a good smell when I first opened the pack, but that is about it. I like a medium to strong flavor in my coffees and this was just plain weak. I guess if you have stomach problems or just like a light coffee this would be great, but anyone who likes alot of flavor won't like this.	2	0

		AT96TYI24GKXH	Mostly Just Sauce	"The variety pack has two flavors and styles of cat food. Chicken Pot Pie:  be careful when you open the can because it is mostly filled with liquid that could easily spill out. it seems to be little square bite size (for cats) pieces of a chicken-like item, in a broth, mostly broth. Each of my cats, one of whom is a fairly picky eater, both seemed to enjoy this food and ate it straight way. Seemed to enjoy I say, since it turns out my picky eater was actually only lapping up the ""soup"" or the sauce, and leaving behind the 8 or so little bits of meat like substance (it could actually be chicken, sure looked like it). And frankly, even with the manufacturer's recommendation of what would amount to 6 or more cans a day for my larger 12 lb cat, just not enough food there to satisfy him, mostly liquid.<br /><br />Chinese Chicken: Once again, fairly saucy, but with a much higher meat:sauce ratio, with what looked like a fair amount of shredded chicken. Once again, my picky eater just lapped up the sauce, and my other big guy, who eats anything, really was not interested, no matter how hungry he was.<br /><br />And please tell me why there are little tiny chunks of carrots in each of these? Cats have no interest in carrots, do they have some need for Vit A that is not fulfilled in the supplementation of this food? I doubt it, that is in there for us humans... stupid.<br />I gave this two stars instead of one, because one of my cats quite liked the sauce."	0	1
		A11V7W73DYY0A	A truly energizing, natural elixir!	I make coconut water a part of my daily regimen, whether I've exercised or not. It gives my body a much better - and healthier - boost than caffeine, and gives me an overall feeling of well-being. I recommend this to everyone, the only downside is one could go broke drinking a liter box every day like I've been doing.	5	0

		A1SLY30AIW1185	Gets the job done	"My fiance' loves fortune cookies so I figured this would be a great creative way to pop the question. Well, she loved the idea when I finally did it last friday (although, somehow she had me figured out from the beginning lol).<br /><br />Anyway, I wasn't particularly thrilled about the quality of these cookies. The seams weren't completely shut. I could see the word ""Will"" through the backside of the cookie.<br /><br />Also, a huge warning for someone looking for an authentic cookie to give.... the wrapper is just that, a plain plastic wrapper. I was expecting some Chinese lettering or some kind of design to make it a little more believeable.<br /><br />And last but not least, the price. For the quality you're getting, I'd be more inclined to try the trick (tutorials online) of opening up a cookie and placing the message inside myself. At least then I could put exactly what I wanted. They are way overpriced for what you're getting.<br /><br />Buy only out of desperation."	1	0
		AZ52YGGY31K31	NOT ENOUGH MANGOS!!!	Each package of mangos is like 25% full, pretty ridiculous if you ask me. Also, the mangos don't taste that good, at least in the package I got. They are not that sweet, and kind of hard to chew. If you want to get dried mangos, I would recommend going to a farmer's market. At least from my experience, the ones there tend to be much sweeter than these.	0	0

		A1X1SE0D8U0XDL	Yummy Coffee	I love the Wolfganag Puck flavors.  This Vienna blend is very nice.  It is medium roast so it is not too strong.  Has a wonderful flavor without being a flavored coffee.  One of my favorites.	0	0

		A32T42NWAJTZV1	The Good and Bad	We have 3 cats, 2 male and 1 female.  They adjusted great on it, and their stool was quite less smelly :)  BUT after 3 weeks of use our female cat developed a urinary tract infection and the doctor said some cats can't handle the high levels of protein in some foods and higher levels of ash, magnesium, and calcium.  He told us to switch foods immediately.  So we did, the last thing you want is a cat with a uti!  If your cats are sensitive like ours seems to be this isn't the food for you!  But for bigger stronger cats it seemed ok.  Our female cat does fine with table scraps, but she is a petite cat so all the protein and minerals was too much for her.  We switched to Purina Pro Plan chicken, special urinary tract formula and they seem to be adjusting well (all 3!)	10	4
		AATO48RRH41PU	Awesome	This is the absolute and complete BEST beef jerky that I have ever had. You'll be hard pressed to find better, if you can. It's tender and has a good bite but at the same time you won't rip your teeth out either. It's also not too salty.	2	1

		AS6SH2JM2YY3H	Pineapple flavored coconut water from Indonesia... there's something we really need!	"Coconut water with a hint of pineapple, shipped to the US from Indonesia, packaged in (usually) non-recyclable, disposable containers, and catering to the... sports drink market (""good source of electrolytes"")?<br /><br />I took a  8.5 ounce container and poured 6 servings, for 4 teenagers and 2 adults.  First impression?  The teens (serious athletes) were not told what the drink was, but I did mention that it was being marketed as a potential sports drink.<br /><br />The result?  No negative votes, but no one would choose it over existing drinks.  Everyone recognized the pineapple flavor instantly.  ""It leaves a strange feeling in my mouth,"" one teen said.  This was probably the coconut water; it had a residual flavor and feel.<br /><br />There was no straw included with the package, so the opening and pouring needed the assistance of a fork or knife.  It's mostly (cane) sugar water, so why bother?<br /><br />But the biggest issue is the waste.  Coconut sugar water from Indonesia?  What's the carbon footprint of this product?  And the container has 2 ""recycle"" symbols on it, but, like milk cartons, it is difficult to find a community that will actually keep them out of the landfill.<br /><br />Bottom line?  It's not that tasty, being little more than sugar water, and the transport and packaging waste really don't fit into a culture (for me) focusing on sustainability."	1	3
		A22A19DIHY5L0G	Super healthy :)	People that research this product knows that is good to lower your cholesterol and is a great food for busy people that can have just juice for breakfast.

		A1MAFNKH2CVMU2	Dangerous and not durable	"This is the second ""Tug-a-Jug"" food puzzle I've purchased for my wire fox terrier. The first lasted about five months until she chewed through the rope. But this toy kept my dog more occupied than any other food puzzle I've tried, so I decided to purchase a second one. My plan was to put this one away as soon as my dog was done with her food so she wouldn't ""play"" with it and chew through the rope. So in other words, I blame my dog's destructive terrier prowess on the demise of the first toy rather than the manufacturer.<br /><br />But after just one week of use for the second toy, the bottom part where the end seals onto the main container literally cracked and shattered into many pieces when I was sealing the toy.<br /><br />My dog may chew through ropes but she's not that rough with toys, and I was using normal strength to twist the end piece on, so I'm pretty sure this one was a dud. But after that, I'm totally done with this company. The shards that came off in my hand were tiny and sharp enough that if just one shard had broken off without my notice and go mixed in with my dog's food, she probably would have ingested it and had internal bleeding."	2	0
		A33OK99AQT4864	This is good coffee	It has a nice strong flavor with no bitterness.<br /><br />How strong is it? I would say it is similar in strength to auto-drip using 1 rounded tablespoon of coffee per 8oz of water.	5	1

		A23W4SGMFMSE5N	Like to gamble? Buying the St. Patty's Dried Fruit Basket is a Crap-Shoot	"Buying this product seems to be almost literally like rolling the dice in a game of craps!<br /><br />My experience with this seems to be similar to the experience of ""Peter R."", unfortunately.<br /><br />The price was excellent.  I ordered mine after the date of "" J. Robert Bois'"" positive experience / review was written but before the date of ""Cindy 2366's"" positive experience / written review.  I bought these & gave them to my Dad, as he *LOVES* dates.  I noticed when I was visiting him, the dried fruit basket was hanging around in his 'fridge a lot longer than any other date basket I had ever ordered for him.<br /><br />Finally I asked him about them.  He said that he did not want to be rude to me or hurt my feelings but....  the dates, well, he was wondering if he should try & eat the seeds in the center & see if they were soft, because the dates themselves were hard as a rock & tasted stale.  I was mortified to say the least...  Then he wanted to know (jokingly) if he had done something to make me mad & I bought these for him as his punishment.  (No, but I had to laugh when he asked about that.)<br />Me personally, I have not tried them.  I will take his word for it!  :)<br /><br />I told him to throw it away or put it out for the squirrels.  After a week of offering the dates,  I picked them up out of his backyard and threw them away.  The squirrels, opossums, & raccoons declined to dine on the dates.<br /><br />It seems to be hit or miss with the ""Broadway Basketeers Irish St. Patrick's Dried Fruit Gift Basket"" purchase.<br /><br />I will not say flat out ""NO!  Do Not Purchase This Item, It is Not Good!""  That is a choice you will have to make on your own.  I just wanted to pass along my experience with the gift basket.<br /><br />Thank Goodness I caught it when it was on special & did not have the full current purchase price invested in the box!  I would have been really sad then!<br /><br />Amazon, as usual, did a fabulous job with the shipping, packaging, and they arrived quickly, in the time frame advertised / promised.<br /><br />Best of luck & I hope others have better experiences than my Dad / I had!<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004134H9W"">Broadway Basketeers Irish St. Patrick's Dried Fruit Gift Basket</a>"	0	0

		A2MGH3MBXMKD96	Quality varies	I have bought these twice now. The first order was great, great flavor, crunchy, very fresh tasting. I was so impressed I quickly ordered a second batch. Since the first were so fresh, I figured they'd last awhile.<br /><br />The second batch was bad. Stale and not very crisp with a sort of mild chemical taste rather then that nice cheesy flavor. I had a hard time believing they were even the same product. I'm eating them slowly because I generally don't believe in wasting food that is edible, but I hesitate now to try other things.	0	0
		AC04MNII0B5B9	Bitter, not bold	I like the flavor of coffee, but Emeril's doesn't have that traditional coffee flavor. It's pretty bitter--so much so, that 2 Splenda packets in a 16 oz cup don't mask the bitterness. Three stars because it's tolerable, but I'm holding out for tastier coffee.	0	0

		A3QJILXTHLKAD2	My picky eater likes these	I was skeptical that my dog would chew on these treats, but he does seem to like them.  They smell like cinnamon and are very low in calories.  My mini dachshund suffered kidney damage after contracting Leptospirosis.  He is on a special diet of rice and a small amount of protein.  Dogs on these diets often suffer from dental disease. I needed something to clean his teeth, but also not introduce high protein to his diet. These chews are 18% crude protein, much lower than other chews, and contain fiber (chia seeds and flaxseed) and antioxidents like green tea. A win-win situation for my dog's overall health.	0	0

		A32T2H8150OJLU	"Switch ""Orange Tangerine"" is misnamed...and perhaps a bit overpriced, and NOT A DIET DRINK!"	"""Switch `Orange Tangerine'"" is advertized as 100% juice with carbonation.  They were accurate as far as the 100% juice and (light) carbonation goes, but imagine my disappointment when I checked the ingredients, and I read the following: ""100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, tangerine, orange, and acerola juice concentrates)...<br /><br />BTW - acerola is also known by the common names Barbados cherry and wild crapemyrtle. It's a berry that has extremely high amounts of Vit C.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the drink.  When I ordered this item I was expecting a carbonated ""orange tangerine"" drink, but that was not the taste I got.  After all, tangerine and orange are present in smaller amounts than grape and apple juices.  As a result this drink had a flavor more like a mixture of sparkling grape and sparking apple combined, with somewhat of a light citrus twist, but less carbonation than either sparkling grape or sparkling apple have.<br /><br />The overall flavor of ""Switch"" was all right, but it was not, in my opinion ""orange tangerine"" at all.  In that respect this drink was a great disappointment.  The manufacturer would have been more accurate to name this drink ""fruit punch"" or ""fruit cocktail"" or perhaps ""grape-apple"".  There is, by the way, already a ""fruit punch"" version...I wonder what's in that flavor that's not in this one?<br /><br />The can size is just adequate at 8.3 oz, but is, I would say, fairly expensive at nearly $1/can, especially when it's not what you thought you were getting.<br /><br />The drink does, to its credit, have 100% of the recommended daily amount of Vit C, and has only natural juices in it.  That is probably true, but...THIS IS NOT A DIET DRINK.  Just because the can says ""no sugar added"", that doesn't mean that there's no sugar in it.  There happens to be a significant amount of sugar in this drink (given the total volume you get/can)...if I recall correctly the contents label said 35g of sugar.  That's because 100% fruit juice is loaded with sugar, sugar like fructose.<br /><br />OK, frankly, the taste combo doesn't particularly appeal to me, that's why I didn't order the grape version of this product, and now that I know what's in the ""orange tangerine"" I wouldn't order it again.<br /><br />I'm torn between 2 and 3 stars though, simply because it's not really an orange-tangerine drink as advertized.  I guess I'll have to go with 2 stars.  (I don't know why 3 stars showed up for this product!?)  Alas..."	0	1

Publix has them on sale from time to time for $4.  Whole foods price is usually around $5. No idea why you buy 3 and pay about 100% more.  Amazon needs to evaluate the price- perhaps should be a 8 pack for the same price.	6	2
		A3DP4Y7VUM63MS	Great product!	This product is excellent! I HIGHLY recommend it... It has the balances of nutrients I was looking for but also non GMO... The product shipped quickly and is very high quality hemp seed oil. I'm extremely impressed! I can't wait to buy my next supply because of all the benefits! I've already noticed a difference in how my skin behaves, how my hair grows and the strength of my nails and I've only been taking it for about 10 days!! I don't experience nearly as much nausea with taking this supplement as I do with others (such as flaxseed oil) and I also don't have to worry about the presence of GMO substances in it either. Thanks again for selling such a wholesome product :)	3	1

		A1Y4NQ8TL8DY0N	Not exactly what I expected	"The cake arrived askew (smooshed, like a smiley) more due to the internal packaging -- it looks like it should have been vacuum sealed.<br /><br />Overall the taste wasn't what I expected - it was kinda yucky/pasty.  The ingredients show corn syrup, which is not suitable for a rum cake glaze.  The taste is likely due to use of a starch.  It's not ""terrible"" per se, but I doubt I'd buy another.<br /><br />I think they can improve the recipe quite a bit."	1	1
		AEO0814DBMGN4	A Little Too Sweet	I bought this cake because I miss the seven layer cakes that are available in New York (where I grew up).  There was not enough cake.  And, the filling was not the light colored chocolate buttercream as shown in the picture. It was more chocolate frosting.	0	0

However, after complaining to Amazon customer service they did refund me half the purchase price. In any case, only 1 star because it was not as advertised.<br /><br />For a better deal, I recommend Frosted Mini-Wheats Bite-Size Cereal, 18-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4).  It is a better price per ounce than this even if I had received both bags as advertised."	1	0
		A3VAVNPZ515HPX	Meh..	I bought a big pack of this gum.  The flavor (Kiwi Watermelon) is ok, but it didn't last long, I found I would usually pop a new piece in my mouth after about 2-3 minutes to get another shot of flavor.  I Wouldn't really recommend this gum, it's not horrible, but not that great either.	2	0
		A2XMSLLYHDZXQH	Very dissapointed.	I truly was looking forward to using these flavored syrups for making Latte's and other coffee drinks. First of all I do not like Splenda sweetener because to me it has a lingering after-taste. I had hopes that the flavored syrup would at least hide the bad taste but to me it only seems to make it worse. I will buy the Torani Flavored syrups again but only in the sugar sweetened versions.The true flavors of these Sugar Free syrups seems to be overpowered by the Slenda after taste.	2	4
		A1V1EP514B5H7Y	Nothing special Indian food	"I cook Indian food frequently and yes, it does take time, so I decided to try a ready made product.  I will not buy these again as they definitely don't have the blending of spices so necessary to get an authentic result.  And, the amount of ""cottage cheese"" was very skimpy."	1	0
		A1LA5T5SXLGFZQ	The best!	Until recently I thought that coffee was coffee but apparently it's not that simple. Drinking coffee can either be an good habit for the environment or a very bad one.<br /><br />The good news is, Going Green is easy! Look for the certification by environmental watch-dogs like the Rainforest Alliance and keep up the demand for Arabica (uh-RA-bih-kuh) or Rainforest Blend coffee; just ask for them at your local grocery store or favorite coffee house.<br /><br />GoGreenMart&More voted Yuban as a Product of the Week because the great taste helps wake you in the morning and protects the environment as well.	1	1

I would have really loved to see the box be larger, I think there are three cups total in the box. Overall the product is amazing though. Everything I've made with it has come out wonderfully and all of the recipes online via Bisquick's website are easy to follow and come out very good. I'd highly recommend this product to anyone.

		AHIK7BUXFRMT8	One of the Best Decaffeninated Coffees I've Tasted	"I am a coffee fan who drinks my coffee black; nothing is added to alter the flavor of the coffee. As a result of this habit I find myself somewhat more critical of how a coffee tastes. As a general rule I prefer an Arabica bean but I could not find a reference to bean type on the bag. Curious I checked their web site and found they use the Arabica bean exclusively.<br /><br />On the front of the bag there is reference to the process used to decaffeinate the Rivera Sunset coffee; the Swiss water process is used. Their web site provides a detailed explanation of this process which involves the removal of water soluble caffeine: ""Unroasted coffee beans are immersed in heated water for several hours to remove the water-soluble caffeine present in the beans, as well as those coffee components that easily dissolve in water. The water is then drained from the beans and filtered or processed to remove the caffeine from the water. This decaffeinated water is then reintroduced to the coffee beans, allowing the flavor and aroma components to be absorbed by the coffee. Finally, the coffee is dried and ready for roasting.""<br /><br />More information is provided on the web site concerning the bean growing and selection process; I found the web site to be user friendly and well thought out.<br /><br />Another habit of mine is the use of distilled water to brew coffee; I've found that public water supplies can provide water with a multitude of different tastes which can negatively influence the flavor of the coffee.<br /><br />Let me finally mention the flavor of the coffee itself. First it is very smooth and rich; I almost never have more than one cup of coffee at a time but found myself thinking more would be nice. That is very rare! The coffee had a delicate fruity flavor which I found pleasing.<br /><br />I did face one challenge with this coffee; the bag was very difficult to open without tearing it. After working on it for several minutes, I had decided I was not going to let a bag beat me, I discovered that I was able to open it be starting at the end where the bag was folded back. Once I got my finger inside the bag the rest came comparatively easy. Fortunately the two small tears I made in the bag were high enough to fold under when the bag was closed. The bag recommends storage in a refrigerator.<br /><br />This coffee is pleasant and refreshing and I have enjoyed drinking it; if you are a coffee lover you owe it to yourself to give this coffee a try and see what you think. I hope you're as pleased with it as I am!"	0	2
		A3DI391K4GAI7Q	Delightfully Delicious & Natural Tasting!	"Firstly, I hate orange flavored sodas. They all taste like ultra-fake chemical laden floor cleaner to me.  Switch is definitely NOT the case.  Finally an orange soda that tastes like real oranges and tangerines- who knew!  I thoroughly enjoyed this fizzy delight, which reminded me of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E3HLX6"">San Pellegrino Aranciata Sparking Beverage - 24/11.5 oz cans</a> but sweeter.

		A16NN54ESNY77G	It's decaf AND excellent!	I've looked everywhere for a decaf espresso for my DeLonghi EC355. Tried coffee from the grocery store but the decaf was never espresso grind, ordered Newman's decaf espresso grind on-line and it wasn't that great. Not good flavor for espresso, and just OK for cappuccino. I tried this on a whim because of the price and the super saver shipping here on Amazon and I was floored with my frist cup! It's rich, it has flavor, the crema is excellent! I have signed up for the auto shipment of this and couldn't be happier. I can finally have excellent Italian coffee and I don't even have to leave home OR go to Italy to find it.	5	0
		A250AXLRBVYKB4	Great Snack!	I have a bit of a sweet tooth. I've tried to ignore it in times past, but the reality is that I want--NEED--a cookie from time-to-time as a welcome addition to my brown bag lunch. These 1.4 ounce single servings make that easy without overdoing it. If I bring one with me I know I'll only end up eating one package and not HALF of a 12 ounce package! Single servings help keep the portion size healthy while not killing your soul by ignoring your need for some desert...<br /><br />Reasonably priced and shipped to your door, these are a great purchase.	1	1

		A1C4JFP5SO2JHQ	Rancid Smell and Taste	I purchased this cereal because it appeared to be very healthy and promising. But once I received it and after smelling and tasting it i knew something was wrong. I know a rancid smell when i smell it. I would not feed this to my baby. I tasted and it left a terrible after taste. I called the company and read other reviews on this defect. The company says since there is less fat in this specific product, a smell has resulted but it does not affect the overall product and is safe to eat. I was sent another container but this had the same smell, so I would conclude that the recently made containers are all like this. The expiration date was in 2013. Sorry, but anything that smells like this I would never give to my baby. However the oat and rice cereals do not have a rancid smell and I give those to my baby every day and do not see a problem with them. I still need to research more into the extraction method of DHA which may also have something to do with the smell.	2	0

		ADQM4H3YPICFF	Nothing great about this	"In fact, I did not like the artificial taste in this orange drink. The degree of carbonation is alright and it does have an ""orangey"" taste to it.

		A2W9I628I6SE1U	Beautiful presentation ...and a pretty good tea too!	For those looking for a more exotic tea drinking experience and who like white Jasmine tea, Numi's Flower Jewel is worth a look. About the size of a gum-ball, these jewels slowly open in water to form a flower shape around the central amaranth flower. They are meant to be decorative so glass teapot is a must when preparing this tea.<br /><br />Decorative does not mean tasteless. As a white tea, the flavor is mild, but rich and soothing. The jasmine is wonderful but does not overpower the tea. I have had stronger jasmine teas, but this one is quite balanced and tasty. I used a small glass pot when preparing it and was able to get more than 7 yummy infusions out of the jewel before the flavor and scent began to fade. The white tea tips are plentiful and of a high quality and don't get bitter if seeped for long periods.<br /><br />I must deduct some points though for the high price to tea ratio and the fragility of the flower jewels. Pouring hot water directly on them can cause pieces to fall of and after the 3rd or 4th infusion more of the flower starts to fall apart, though to be fair the main flower shape remains fairly intact. Some even come out of the box starting to missing the central flower or bits of leaf. Better packaging might solve this.<br /><br />If you want a tea experience that looks as good as it tastes and smells, or are entertaining and want a conversation piece, then Numi Tea Flower Jewel should be on your short list.	0	0

		AIST7V8XF4A18	Good, But Sweet and Tart	The Switch Juice is pretty good!  It is 100% Juice, and LOADED with complex carbohydrates!  It has to be loaded, considering the 135 calories (at a little over 8 oz), and the 33g (!!!) of sugar.  I did like the sweet/tart taste which reminded me of the candy with the same name.  I also liked the fact that it's carbonated, but not too noticeable because of the sweet/tart taste.<br /><br />The pros of the Switch Juice are:<br />No Sugar Added<br />No Corn Syrup<br />No Preservatives<br />No Artificial Colors<br />100% Pure Juice<br />All Natural<br /><br />The cons:<br />The price per can (considering 8.3oz size)<br />The calorie load<br />The sugar content<br /><br />So, if you like juice and are looking for something to drink after a long workout, this one is a good choice.  You get energy and great taste in a somewhat small can.  Gatorade is much cheaper and a better choice for quenching thirst.	1	0

		A1SJMAF4M4WCHB	Check the EXPIRATION DATE!!!!	These candies are great if they are NOT expired. I have ordered these candies from several different sellers on multiple occasions and I have consistently received expired products. Additionally, some sellers put company stickers over top of the expiration date so you can't tell when the product expires. Beware of the following sellers as I have had trouble with each of them: Toys Samurai, ABCTOY4me and ToysDiva. I have reported each of them to Amazon (4 different complaints in the past 4 months) and Amazon has done nothing to stop them from sending out expired products or products with hidden expiration dates. Good luck.	0	0

Luzianne Cajun seasoning<br />1 Tbsp. olive oil<br />2 Tbsp. lemon juice<br /><br />Combine ingredients with chicken in a gallon size zip lock bag and marinate chicken legs & thighs for 2 - 4 hours.<br /><br />Mix up a second batch, and brush over chicken while grilling, cooking on all sides.<br /><br />Just made this yesterday...excellent!	0	0
		A159699NARVH23	Horrible. Worst Root Beer EVER!	I love Sky Blue sodas. And when I saw the Creamy Root Beer, as someone who loves all root beer, I ordered a case. Got it today, chilled a six pack for a few hours. Then poured one in a glass. Tasted it. Almost vomited. And then proceeded to dump them all down the drain. Horrible, horrible taste. I don't get how this can taste so bad, and all the others are so so good.	4	2

		A2BTKW7194ON92	Cooked?	"My son wouldn't eat it either! I tasted it... I would not eat it, also. Tasteless, unappetizing in texture and  flavor.<br />It says ""minimal processing""... does that mean it is not even cooked? No wonder our babies and toddlers hate it!!! I would NEVER knowingly feed my child or myself RAW meat."	1	4
		A3U1WPDQLP9CQ	Tasty Carbonated Orange Juice	If you like a little fizz with your juice this is a good product.  Tasty and refreshing.  However, like all juice it is not low in calories, so don't buy it expecting it to be more like a low cal fruit flavored sport drink.	0	0
		A3HPCRD9RX351S	Passed the Taste Test	No matter how wholesome a snack may be, it's worthless unless the girls approve. In this case they both give the Science Diet Jerky Treats two paws up. I like that beef is the first ingredient in the recipe and there are none of those unrecognizable ingredients created in a science laboratory.<br /><br />The treats are a nice size and have just enough chew to satisfy. For Piper, our shih tzu with a few missing teeth, I break the treats into smaller pieces so she can manage them.<br /><br /> On the package:<br />Use within 3 weeks of opening.<br />100% satisfaction guaranteed<br />Keep this bag out of the reach of pets and children.	2	0

		A2H5RIAZ70GNWN	My Pop Chips were rancid	I have ordered my Pop Chips from Amazon for months. The last boxful was nasty. My whole family agreed and we threw them out. They tasted old and rancid. I wrote this to Amazon and never heard a word back about it. I just cancelled my regular delivery.	4	3
		A1TKVL7VNZZWX1	Works for me!	I really like this flavoring. I try to stay away from sugar and artificial sweeteners so this was perfect because it contains absolutely no sweetener so I can add my own (mostly liquid stevia).  I also love vanilla flavoring in many things I make so I sometimes use this in place of extract which can be pricey if you use it a lot. For example, I make my own almond milk so I like to add vanilla to sweeten and lighten the taste. This works better than an extract because there is no alcohol taste. I also make blueberry syrup with agave and this flavoring and it turns out very good. I put it in pancake batter and the flavor still holds after cooking (also with cookies). I use this all the time and now I am not dropping $10 every couple of weeks for vanilla extract.	0	0

		A3FIV3X7H4VLI7	Not as good	My daughter did not like this flavor, she will eat it with a little bit of vegetable or fruit puree every other bite.  It is a bit of a struggle, and honestly it is a strong fishy smell coming out of the package.  This is also a chunkier and drier pouch compared to the other flavors.	0	0
		A22D10SGYUVKSW	Great Taste, WAY too expensive!	This is great tasting coffee, especially for decaf, BUT I couldn't believe there was only 1 packet of 24.......my mistake, there are usually 50 or more, I didn't read through the description......I will buy this again if the price comes down.	1	4

		A3TDUTGG4C51PQ	Only 1 Box!	The picture of this product shows 3 boxes of rice.  I received the order today and there is only one box.  This means I paid $9 for one box of rice.  Insane!  Otherwise, it's a great product, and I highly recommend it for people wanting to make meals quickly.	0	1
		A3LFZ77WA9XVYT	Rejects????	I ordered the case of twelve.  Every single can is dented...badly dented.  Were these rejects from a grocery store?  I do not buy dented cans in the grocery store, and I was not at all happy to receive an entire case of dented cans.  The packaging was fine, so the cans had to be dented before they were packed.  I am rethinking Amazon's subscription service for food items.  There is no savings if the product is virtually unusable.  Unfortunately, I cannot comment on the actual product because of the condition the cans arrived in.	1	0
		A1B70ZEWQ6UH1A	good idea, so-so product	If giving your kids, or yourself, carbonated juice gets them (or you) to drink more juice and less soda, that's good.  But the taste of this is similar to the juice in juice boxes.  It's a blend of juices with a fruit punch type of flavor.  It's also quite pricey.  Interesting once, but I won't be buying more.	0	0
		A3S87ZOPB3UM9N	Smooth rich coffee, but better with my proportions	Smooth rich coffee, comparable to a local favorite.  However better when I used the proportions, I prefer with my coffee maker.<br />Often I find, when I follow the coffee manufacturer's recommendation for coffee, I find it too strong.  This was no exception.<br />I prefer 5 coffee scoops (essentially 15 teaspoons) to 64 ounces of water.  The manufacturer recommended 2 teaspoons for each 6 ounces of water, which would have been about 21-22 teaspoons. Slightly different, but harsher tasting.<br /><br />All in all a good cup of coffee.	0	0

		A1Y54O9NW57TG6	Nice but too pricey.	If you need a biscuit fix this is good, but costs too much (Should be 1/3 the price). A better way is to get the book 'Carb Wars: Sugar is the New Fat' (ISBN 0979201802) and use the cooked gluten flour secret to make your own for much less money. (The Popovers are great!)	12	0
		AHRNDSKWH1YBT	WHOO WEE That is a Sweet Drink!!	Don't get me wrong, it is good. It is sweet and tart. It is slightly fizzy but not overly so. It is just big enough to quench your thirst before it gets warm.<br /><br />But WOW, it was sweet. I mean, this is Kool-aid meets Grenadine syrup with some lemon-lime soda tossed in. So if you are looking for something like soda water with a slight flavor, just keep going. If you want a sweet drink to get rid of a craving, then this is for you!	0	0

		A36EA1M8V6GNPG	Taste yummy but watch out for yeast extract intolerance!	Yum! I had tried the original and the Bar-b-q and really liked them so decided to get the variety pack. For whatever reason the 24 pack is cheaper then the 12. The flavored ones do contain a yeast extract which is similar to MSG and gave my grandmother a bad headache. So if you know anyone that has a sensitivity to MSG, do not give them these.  These are tasty and a nice substitute for a greasy potato chip but they are not filling. You are better off eating a granola bar.	0	0
		A1UCF02ZD1ML5M	Fave K-cup French Roast	"Love this blend, so was delighted to find it on your ""Subscribe & Save"" program (at a better price<br />than w/Keurig.  So REALLY disappointed to learn today it was no longer available on said program.<br />Shame on manufacturerer!"	0	0
		A3C6T903HRU0TQ	VERY DISAPPOINTING	We have this model about a year now.  It hasn't worked right from the beginning.  We often had trouble closing the top.  Sometimes it doesn't work at all.  Other times it works like a charm.  When it works like a charm, it's not uncommon to find coffee grounds in the cup. It's a mess.  I bought the same model for the office. The experience was similar.  Sometimes it makes a full cup of coffee other times it doesn't.  Sometimes it won't even work at all.  We have to turn it on and off and cross our fingers. A friend reports these problems as well.  I agree with the reviewer who says, DO NOT BUY.  A waste of money for the machine,for the K-cup that couldn't be used, and an exercise in frustration. We're in the market for a different brand.  When Keurig first came out, they had the market.  They have a lot of competition now . . . which hopefully will make it easier to find a machine that works well.	5	0
		A2F3F2FZ5YAKKT	A great discovery!	We love this sauce and are hunting around to find it and to introduce it to others. Sort of a wasabi mayonnaise--and terrific on fish, potatoes, and many other things (we're eager to discover more).	0	0
		A2S3VA3J6K9E1S	Bitter tasting	After reading the positive reviews I thought I'd give this product a try. I do not know how anyone can say this tastes like sugar. This stuff is awful, the after taste was agonizing. I could smell the difference in the coffee let alone taste it. I am so glad I do not have to use this in place of sugar I was just trying to cut some calories. I am so glad I have alternatives to choose from. It's Splenda for me. The site would not allow me to place the review without giving the product a star but it is a zero in my book.	6	9
		A1G0VFQ9198IUF	i love candy	i love these pop.  these are rather small pops about 1/2 the size of a tootsie pop.  they come in many flavors.  i think this bag is great in the long run.  300 just think Halloween.	0	0

		AO4UH9E8UN2ZJ	Very cute pops	"I ordered the lollipops for party favors at my son's 1st birthday party.  The lollipops are 2 inches and I used 1.5 inch ""thank you"" stickers on them.  So cute!  The description states that 16 lollipops are included in the order.  I ordered 2 boxes and only received 12 lollipops in each box.  I contacted the seller's customer service.  I received a response and apology right away.  They promptly corrected the order.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive another full box of 12 and not just the 8 I expected.  The lollipops are wrapped in bubble wrap.  Out of three boxes only one lollipop was cracked.  Not a big deal to me since I did receive an extra box.  Great lollipop at a great price."	0	0
		A2CYZN9K7ECMV5	Have to make the tea strong.	I am having to change my original post on this tea. My husband and I both suffer from sinus problems. I made up a big tea pot (with 2 tea bags) and let it steep for 15 minutes. I had 2 cups and my husband had one. Neither of us noticed any difference with our sinuses. A few days later I decided to try the tea again. I brewed one cup of tea with one tea bag. I let it sit again for several minutes. I guess the first time I tried it I did not make it strong enough. This time I noticed a difference as my sinuses are a little clearer.	0	0

		APBYD0H2SWI0F	kittens will eat it as a last resort	bought both the savory seafood and the chicken and wheat germ, as the kittens liked the fish, chicken and liver flavor.  They are not so fond of it, but will eat if there is nothing else.  Also, they will only eat it as soon as a can is opened, there is no hope of putting half a can in tupperware and feeding it to them later. Oh, yeah, and STINKY.  But a good product if your kitty likes the taste.	2	0
		ADBCO3SNTV445	1 Star may be generous...	I'm not a Jerky expert or anything like some of the reviews here. But I've had a few different brands, some the national brands and some smaller ones. I'd have to say this is a bit below average. It was slightly spicy but not terribly tasty and the texture wasn't that good. I didn't get the feeling I was eating quality meat.<br /><br />So why 1 star? Easy. Within 48 hours of opening it I was greeted with bluish white mold covering about 5 or 6 pieces. I'm sure by tomorrow it will be more but it's now in the trash. I don't even know how that happens	2	1

		A3IFL9C0AQ90XF	Can't find it in stores	This is the best coating/glaze to help make BBQ Chicken. I never can find it is the stores so I always buy it here and it is so much cheaper then a store. I pour it in a pie pan roll the chicken in it then bake. After I roll all the chicken I put the remaining glaze in a Zip Lock gallon bag and place in the freezer till the next time. Sometimes I mix the glaze with plain Chicken Shake n Bake for a crunchy BBQ coating.	1	0
		AMLIRJ3CL48W2	My Dogs Hate This Food	If this is supposed to be a top notch dog food, my dogs sure don't think so. There is a very odd smell to this food, it almost smells as if it is bad. Same smell came from the Bison flavor as well.  My dogs won't eat it.  Obviously other dogs like it otherwise they'd be out of business. Sorry I wasted money on 2 cases of this stuff.	1	0
		A1B73WBT0EUCSO	Dog won't eat it.	My pug is, perhaps, too spoiled when it comes to treats. I ordered the chicken and the beef and gave her the chicken first. She turned her nose away. I chopped it and added gravy. She ate the gravy. So I cannot attest to the effectiveness of the product.	1	1
		A35AFK2H8HDMU6	Crunchy, healthy, satisfying goodness in every bite!	"Been munching on these for now 10 or so years. Can't believe I didn't write a review earlier! Basically these are your healthier, organic alternative to regular popcorns. You might be surprised by its much firmer texture (than popcorn) at first, but go through a couple, and if you're like me, you'll appreciate the quality crunch and just the right balance of sea salt! I was hooked so fast, I was just chugging the ziplock bag into my mouth for a mouthful of tasty treat, and no, didn't need to reseal the pouch! The spicy version is just as good - it isn't that spicy (it's ""slightly spicy"") and highly addictive. Try both and you will not go back to those greasy popcorns! Yay for Grandpa Po's!"	0	0
		A1U649FUSUINKH	LOVE IT!!!!!	i had a kerig before and it broke. the company said it was because i was using expresso in the k-cup and it was to fine and cloged the machine. kerig does not make a k-cup with spanish coffee so when i found these i was very happy. i have been using these for about a month and i love them and it is so much cheaper. i would highly recommend these.	0	0

		AY12DBB0U420B	No cholesterol. No Sodium. Not Very Sweet. Good Taste.	In my trip through the health area of my local food market I stumbled upon Enjoy Life Boom Choco Boom Dark Chocolate Bar. I just can't resist trying things such as this. Into the cart it went. It's rather good. It says it's dairy, nut and soy free, and I'll take their word. The question is taste. Well, it's a good tasting bar. I have a couple others that I would regard higher. but this one is quite good. It's a bit high in calories (170 per bar) but has no cholesterol or sodium. Not bad. I'll pick it up again.<br /><br />Gary Peterson	0	0
		A1NUGHVW06D9AA	CAT PUKED after eating this runny slop	"This slop has the color and consistency of baby diarrhea with whole peas in it. Our cat ate less than half a bowl of this slop and immediately puked all over the carpet!<br /><br />She devours the Felidae Platinum, (which we feed as an occasional alternative to Newman's Own Turkey). She was raised on Felidae dry, so I can say that generally the Canidae Company provides quality products... except for this grain-free slop. You can find the good stuff at: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFL09S"">Felidae Canned Cat Food for Senior and Overweight Cats, Platinum Diet Formula (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)</a><br /><br />Absolutely do not order this slop from Amazon because they will charge you $10.70 for the privilege of returning the 11 cans your cat will not eat. Before you make the same stupid mistake I did, buy a can from your local pet food store and try it out first. Then, when your cat pukes this slop back up, you will only be out $1.59 instead of the $27.94 Amazon nailed me.<br /><br />In my opinion, your cat and you will be much better off with Newman's Own Organic cat food, especially the turkey and chicken. The Newman food literally brought our cat back from the brink of death! After we listened to our former vet and fed her Science Diet K/D, she dropped down to less than 4 pounds in a month. We switched her back to Newman's Own Turkey and within one 24-case of small cans she was back up to her usual weight of 6.2lbs, and has maintained that healthy weight for over 6 months. She also gained increased mobility after we stopped feeding her the K/D. I read somewhere that Science Diet buys veterinary students their books in exchange for their later recommendations of their products. Nice.<br /><br />Just say NO to Science Diet and Felidae Grain Free Formula. Here's the good stuff: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK8HJ0"">Newman's Own Organics Turkey & Vegetable Formula for Cats, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br /><br />(Did they really want me to post a video with this review?

		A293G2YSRLXGG0	The best yet found	"I learned about these from a co-worker after he made a bulk purhcase of several kinds of beef sticks a year ago.  He spread them around and so I got to sample a variety: I've ordered the Honey Stung four times since then. Two other co-workers have also ordered them on several occassions this past year and they're ""believers"" too.  Additionally, we've all ordered several of the Buffalo Bills brands and they're all superb!  As long as you don't eat the whole bag, I'd also call these ""Atkins friendly"" as well, as that is also a motivator for me ordering these so many times (other than them being just being great, well-seasoned snacks).  Buy 'em, you'll love 'em!"	0	0
		AUE05A41ALEPX	Highest quality, delicious food for your cats!	My cats both LOVE this food.  I've had varying success with about 7 different kinds of canned food.  This one is a hit with both.  It's natural, mostly organic, doesn't have any junk or fillers, and I have peace of mind knowing that we're giving them high quality food from an ethical company.  Since they've been on this diet they are more active, alert and happy.  Their coats are so soft and shiny and they seem to be shedding less.  Cannot say how relieved I am to have finally found a food they like that is so good for them as well.  It is pricey but if you want to save on costly vet bills down the road due to illness caused by poor nutrition, this is the way to go.	2	0
		A8QITLROF01FW	Pretty Good	A nice juice drink, but it just didn't grab me like other flavors did. I would probably not purchase it in the future, though I did not dislike it. Like I said, it just didn't grab me.	0	0
		A1X9OJN30EBE3M	At 135 Calories Per 8 Ounces, This Was Not What I Was Hoping For	"UPDATE: April 3, 2009<br />I ""ordered"" this drink through the Vine program based upon the description (see below). I was hoping that it would be what it claimed: ""A HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE."" Upon getting this drink I realized that it was actually a fruit juice product, which as such cannot be ""healthy."" Fruit juice consumption is one of the larger contributing/leading causes of weight gain. Therefore the following review is an exposition of why I, along with the dietitians and nurses that I work with at the Veterans Administration, have rated this a one star product.<br /><br />As an avid diet soda drinker who consumes at least 100 ounces per day, I am always looking for alternatives.  Sadly, Switch is anything but that.  Switch is little more than Shasta (TM) non-caffeinated sodas, but with a few more calories!  The ""diet"" drink I was hoping it would be, turned out to be nothing short of ""off the diet.""  As far as I am concerned, Switch is a ""wolf in lamb's clothing"" for those who consider themselves ""heath conscious.""<br /><br />The description, which is rhetoric at its best, states:<br /><br />""The Switch is a great tasting HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE [emphasis added] to soda. The Switch is 100% juice that is carbonated and contains 100% of DV [Daily Value--not Recommended Daily Amount--based on a 2000 calorie diet] of Vitamin C. It has no sugar added and contains nothing artificial. Its just juice, bubbles and Vitamin C. You'll love The Switch because it has the bold taste and nutritional value of a FORTIFIED [emphasis added] juice, with the carbonated refreshment of a soda.  The Switch is 100% of what you want in a soda, and 0% of what you don't[.]""<br /><br />Here is what the label actually provides--again, based upon what they call Daily Value (DV), similar to regular sodas:<br />Serving Size: 8.3 fl oz (245 ml)<br />Servings [per can]: 1<br />Total Fat: 0g  0% DV<br />Sodium: 15mg  1% DV<br />Total Carb: 34g  11% DV<br /> SUGAR [emphasis added]: 33g<br />Protein: 0g  0% DV<br /><br />Then separately listed:<br />Vitamin C: 100%<br /><br />There is no direct indication of the amount of Vitamin C, nor is there any direct indication that the Vitamin C--contrary to their description--is not added; just as the sodium is added.  Since it is listed separately, and other sodas indicate they are NOT a source of Vitamin C, I must conclude that the Vitamin C does not come from the juice, but is added.<br /><br />Relative to the regular soda that I am currently drinking (I grabbed the wrong bottle), Coca-Cola Cherry (TR), Switch Black Cherry has 6g more carbohydrates (listed as ""Carb"" above), but 10mg more sodium--although both amounts are listed as 1% of the Daily Value--than 8oz of the Coca-Cola Cherry (TR) soda pop.<br /><br />As for actual ingredients, here is a comparison of Switch Black Cherry and Coca-Cola Cherry (TR):<br />Switch: 100% JUICE (FILTERED SPARKLING WATER SUFFICIENT TO RECONSTITUTE JUICE CONCENTRATES, APPLE, GRAPE, KIWI, ACEROLA, RASPBERRY AND STRAWBERRY JUICE CONCENTRATES), NATURAL FLAVORS, ASCORBIC ACID (VITAMIN C).<br /><br />Coca-Cola (TR): CARBONATED WATER, HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, CARMEL COLOR, PHOSPHORIC ACID, NATURAL FLAVORS, CAFFEINE [23 mg/8 fl oz].<br /><br />Given that acerola is high in Vitamin C, and used in baby foods, I am unsure why ascorbic acid is added to the Switch.  Phosphoric acid is added to soda and other foods to acidify them; that is, to give them a tangy or sour taste--which is derived from the fruit in Switch--at a lower cost that extracting it from fruit.  The carbohydrates in the Switch drink are primarily from the juice, while the corn syrup provides all the carbohydrates in the Coca-Cola (TR).  So, in the end, the only real inexpedience difference in the source of carbohydrates; excluding the added caffeine to this particular soda.<br /><br />That leaves taste.  And to be honest, I prefer sugar substituted soft drinks--and was hoping that Switch would be a way to avoid using sugar substitutes, since some poorly done research suggests that sugar substitutes lead to people consuming more calories (a whole different story, but one I was hoping that Switch would help with).  That said, I must agree with other reviewers that I found the drink to be overly sweet, as did the four other people with whom I shared this drink.  Indeed, I would compare Switch Kiwi with Crystal Light or Sam's Choice with sugar substitute made with too little Club Soda.<br /><br />But drinking Switch MAY BE COOL!?"	1	2

He's not not a monster dog by any means but this just couldn't hold up to my dog.	0	0
		A2YIZ917XORVV6	Expensive!  Huge increase in price.	My dogs are absolutely crazy about these; they're like crack for dogs.  I last purchased some in Fall 2010 for $14 for 24; then we decided to take a break from them for awhile to ease the addiction.  Feeling soft, I thought to purchase some again.  Now, less than a year later in June 2011, they are almost $20 for 24.  That's an outrageous price increase in a short amount of time.  Yes, those of us who have dogs love our dogs, but I feel like our love for them is being taken advantage of.  I can only imagine what the profit margin is...	1	0

		APTZFVMFYHIQ2	popchips	These popchips are a great alternative when you need a munchie, crunchie snack. They are much lower in calories/fat than regular chips and are portioned controlled. I especially like the barbeque flavor or the salt and pepper flavored popchips.	0	1
		A3OBSKAU6LEEII	Rancid Batch	"We have loved this product until the last few days.  As I was playing w/my daughter who is 20 months, she said ""mommy tummy hurts"" and I heard it gurgling.  Her dad heard and said:  ""...well I opened a new can of Oatmeal yesterday, and it smelled horrible, looks very different than past cans"".  Sure enough, I opened it and it was horrible smelling and looked bad  (as noted in other reviews, dark grey flakes mixed in, much darker than normal).  There MUST be something wrong - I plan to contact the company tomorrow and would NOT recommend right now."	4	2
		A1WVOM1UQU9ZN0	The World's Best Sweetener	Stevia is pretty much the only natural zero-calorie sweetener there is, but most of the time the powdered stevia is so bitter!  Not Nustevia!  Nustevia has absolutely NO bitterness, and tastes EXACTLY like real sugar!  It's amazing!  Add it to plain yogurt, you have an amazing guilt-free dessert, breakfast, side dish, snack.  Add it to tea, coffee, recipes, anything!  It is a truly magical product, and it is cheaper in the 12 oz container on Amazon than anywhere else!  They also sell it at GNC, but it is $10 for 4 oz.  Also, for drinks, I highly recommend the extremely potent liquid stevia, as sometimes the powdered version takes a while to dissolve in iced beverages (it eventually does dissolve, though).	0	0
		AS0SPE5TEM74Z	Needs more lemon flavor	Not much of a lemon flavor for lemon cookies, more on the sweet side.  Coconut is listed in the ingredients, but you certainly won't taste it.  My son liked them, so they won't go to waste.  I would not buy them again.	1	0

On these days, Dr. McDougall's products are lifesavers! I keep some fresh, washed veggies in my office fridge and can have a great meal ready in 5 minutes. Just microwave this one, for instance, while cutting up some broccoli, peppers, a carrot, and whatever else I have around (I also added half of a slim yellow squash the other day, cut in little ""twigs"" - delicous!) By the time you're through cutting, you'll have finished with cooking the soup and the soup's ""standing"" time will be almost over. (It needs a few minutes to thicken up.) Take a tablespoon of the broth and a tablespoon of water, add the veggies and the liquid to a big bowl, toss the veggies in the liquid, and microwave for about 1 minute 30 seconds. When through, dump the soup and noodles on top and you have a delicious, healthy meal. The men in my office come sniffing around when the aroma of the soup comes out of the microwave -- several are now also fans, despite being initially worried by the fact that the meal is vegan. When I am organized enough to remember to wash and bring it in, I add a spring onion on top (I just use an office scissors to cut it.) If you can afford the calories, a few drops of toasted sesame oil is a nice addition, as well, as is tamari. YUMMY!"	0	0
		A1D23KFV2A24OV	Not strong enough	The coffee has decent flavor, but even in an 8oz cup, the coffee is a little on the weak side.	0	0
		A3325Y4F55MG8T	yucky	I was very excited to try this coffee flavor, but when I did, I was very dissapointed.  I think the flavor is too strong, especially since it tastes really fake.  It almost tastes like there is alcohol in it.  Since I ordered the double box, I gave one away to a friend who likes this flavor. I would never buy this coffee again.	0	0
		A1JOCFRO3UC0QE	It's a good toy but not as fun to play with as other toys.	I gave this to my dogs to see how they'd take to it.  They both seem confused by it.  At first it just sat on the floor, untouched for a couple of days.  I figured I'd try to lure them into playing with it by putting some really really yummy people food in it for them to sniff out. That definitely worked.  But they lose interest in the toy itself once the treats are gone.  Unlike another toy I purchased that they play with whether or not it has treats in it.<br />You have to show your dog how the treats slide out when you tug on the rope. I don't think my dogs are stupid but they just didn't get it until I went over it a couple of dozen times with them.	0	0
		A1ALOTXWL76OY7	Just OK	I thought these were ok. Not great but not terrible. I'll end up eating the rest of them but I don't know if I'll continue to buy them. I like that they are individually packaged. I like their medium size. I like that they are soft-baked.<br /><br />Otherwise I thought they were rather dry and tasteless and they did a lot of crumbling.  The almonds were whole but small and the chocolate was in small chunks but there weren't enough of either to be a very strong taste.  I even thought it could have used more oatmeal which maybe would have kept it from being so crumbly.<br /><br />I guess I was just expecting more of a sweet taste from something with chocolate and almonds.  Adding brown sugar probably would have ruined the nutrition label but it would have helped the taste problem considerably.	1	0

		A7SK91SE8UZE6	MY DOG HATED THEM	My little dog wouldn't even lick it, she isn't going to even get close to it.  Beware!  She loves her treats and I was hoping after reading the other reviews that it would be good for her and her breath, but what a waste of $5.  So frustrated!<br /><br />Just a friendly warning, you might have to send them back.	0	3
		A3I517529KWCR9	excellent if made with Almond Milk and Bananas	I am vegan and used to smoke pot and had no issues with eating stems and seeds.  I also didn't mind water with the plain hemp protein powder but this flavor made it nasty and slimy.<br /><br />However, a banana and some almond milk made it taste awesome, mouth watering awesome but it is cheaper to just get the 3 lb bag IMHO.<br /><br />It is healthy and wish it was more popular because maybe there would be demand for better flavor and quality but sadly, it is associated with Marijuana, the drug that is less addictive than caffeine but loaded with propaganda that make people fear using this extremely healthy food.	1	0
		A3MGP2E1ZZ6GRB	it's oatmeal	What else do you need to know? Oatmeal, instant (make it with a half cup of low-fat milk and add raisins;nuke for 90 seconds). More expensive than Kroger store brand oatmeal and maybe a little tastier or better texture or something. It's still just oatmeal. Mmm, convenient!	1	0

		A38AKD7TL2WWCR	Did Nothing	I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about. I followed the directions nothing happened. Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea. On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else. Strange.	0	2
		A3PLBX81BVAQXR	Cat lethargic and sick for two days	My one year old cat ate a few of these and seemed lethargic.  Two weeks later I gave him a large helping of these<br />and I thought he was going to die.  He laid around and would not eat or move for two days.  I will not feed him these<br />again.  Same thing happened to my parent's cat after eating the salmon variety.	0	0

		A1EE44Y697L7W5	Decent canned clam chowder	I've had better canned clam chowder.  Bookbinders is one that comes to mind.  I don't buy the ones with preservatives or a long list of ingredients, so my choice is limited.  For this one, if I add just half a can of milk and a pat of butter, along with some extra sea salt, it's ok.  The longer it is gently heated -- not simmered or boiled -- to let the flavors mingle, the better it becomes.  More clams and potatoes would improve it.  As it is, the ingredients were skimpy.	3	1
		A3NYTSAEPZDJ7Y	He ate them begrudgingly	"I was excited to offer these seemingly healthy treats to my dog, as I love other Newman's Own products such as their spaghetti sauce.  My dog Kirby was very excited as I opened the package and announced ""Ooooh, I have a treeeeeat for you!"" in the high pitched voice I use to get him worked up.  However, it was all downhill from there.  He eagerly took a cookie in his mouth, then gave me a look like ""Seriously?""  He will eat them, but only if there is nothing better going.<br />  My husband was going to try one to give a second opinion.  However, after smelling them he announced that they smell like burnt oatmeal and probably taste like it too, and he refused to try them.<br />  I give these 2 stars because I would like my dog to eat them (as opposed to fatty pig ears), but he really doesn't care much for them.  He gets about as excited to eat these as I do to eat a Triscuit."	5	3

		AY12DBB0U420B	Oh, My! This Stuff Is Delicious!	My nearby Fresh and Easy Market (an English company) has a variety of English fruit spreads and I'm enjoying trying them out. One of the latest is James Keiller & Son Dundee Ginger Preserve. Oh, my! This stuff is just delicious. I've always liked ginger, but as a spread it's just fantastic! What a nice flavor for my breakfast toast! I can hardly wait to try this out on other folks. Or I could give a jar here and there as gifts. I'm sure they'd be appreciated.<br /><br />Gary Peterson	0	0

		A6FIAB28IS79	Best of Breed	"I started eating these after reading Esselstyn's popular book on heart disease (heal through eating oatmeal).  There's no way I can choke down cooked oat meal; eating oatmeal cookies, on the other hand, is something I can swallow.  All of Erin Baker's cookies appear to be made with oatmeal, and the three that I've tried are palatable enough.  Nevertheless, the Fruit & Nut flavor was the one flavor of the three that I most looked forward to savoring each morning (I hope it wasn't because of lower oatmeal content than the other three).<br /><br />In short, you don't have to be the Cookie Monster to like these. Nor do you--despite the ""Fruit & Nut"" flavor--have to be a little ""fruity"" (to quote Norman Bates' audible thoughts in Hitchcock's ""Psycho"") or a ""health nut"" to find these tasty and nutritious--maybe even therapeutic (Dr. Esselstyn would seem to think so). And the advantage of the ""mini"" size is that you might feel better--less guilty, at least--about knocking off two instead of just one cookie at a time."	3	0

		A198FU6P1BVUNZ	Beautiful, Aromatic, Fresh	I could smell the vanilla from the box it was packaged in. It was sealed shut, air extracted from the packaging, so plump & moist.  I specifically got this product based on the comments left from a Pastry Chef.  I am extremely happy with my purchase.  I will definitely be back for these again.  I use them in frosting and cake batters - it's soooooo good, words cannot describe the freshness you get with a real vanilla bean vs. an extract.  They were very easy to extract the beans from.	0	0
		A2NVAGB5ZV1QH7	good chips but....	The flavors are kind of funky salt and pepper? Tastes like someone just pored a jar of black pepper over the chips and the salt and vinegar, thee two varieties just make one go yummm EWWWWWW tossed out those verities but the others were very good. Less chip and more like a cracker with a chip flavor. Still a good item but I wouldn't suggest the variety pack unless you living dangerous and have lots of water to gag them down with.	1	3
		ANYAQ3TVKP69E	Glorified Cup of Noodles	For a 220 calorie dish that can sit in your desk drawer indefinitely, this really isn't bad. It's certainly better than Chef Bouyardee or Easy Mac or actual Cup of Noodles. I've only ever had one other Dr. McDougall's product which was the Tortilla Soup and I much preferred it. I found this one to be a bit bland. It was pretty much just dried Cup of Noodles type noodles with some peanutty powder and a few green onions. I think the peanut flavor could have been more pronounced and I wasn't crazy about the texture of the noodles. I guess I was hoping for a bit more than ramen with peanut sauce.<br /><br />I only gave this three stars because I thought it was a bit of a let down. I liked it but I didn't love it as much as I should have given my love of peanut sauce. I would maybe buy it again at a grocery store if it was on sale but I certainly don't see myself buying them in bulk from amazon. My go-to Desk Drawer food is still Annie Chun's Udon Noodle Soup Bowl. The calorie count is pretty similar (I think Annie Chun's is like 280 or so) but the texture of the noodles is far superior because they use the vacuum sealed pre-cooked noodles. However, if you're not in the mood for soup, these peanut noodles may be a better way to go after all.	0	0
		ASTPREXG8YFDK	Great infant formula!	We bought this after reading about it on Dr. Sear's website. Our son has had no problems at all with the formula, we add brown rice syrup per our pediatricians recommendation (to add calories) Our son was a preemie, and was EBF for the first 7 months until stress from work affected milk production. Our son took to the goats milk right away, we mixed the first couple bottles with breastmilk until we knew he had no digestive issues with it, then were able to give him goats milk by itself. The goats milk smells and tastes better when warm than cold. I grew up on goats milk myself, so the taste doesn't bother me, but my husband isn't crazy about. Good thing our son loves it, because that's what really counts! It's 1/3 the cost of convential (cow's milk based) formula and is easier for tiny tummies to digest. It's a win-win all around!	2	0

		A3JBI5QDS32UEM	Great for teething	I loved this product for fruits and other food that I didn't want my new baby to choke on.  I also used it to put ice in when my baby was teething. It worked great for this, as well as for the food. I didn't like bananas in it though-impossible to get clean!	0	0
		A1DOG75V4DP366	Big Cookie, Small Flavor	The cookies are soft but very dry and tasted nothing like an oatmeal cookie. It reminded me more of a Keebler Soft n Chewy cookie, with a few almond bits tossed in.  If the bits of almonds and chocolate were bigger I think my kids would of liked these cookies. They all passed on having a second cookie. These won't be making it into the lunchboxes this year.	0	0
		A1OW05IFB843RN	Toffee taste is great...but...	The toffee taste is very good.  It's buttery and rich, like English Toffee.  But, the stevia is very bitter.  I don't understand why the sweetener is so bitter.  I will stick with my Xylitol and know that I am helping my oral health with it's use.	0	0
		A2GUXMZO9WBSL8	hazelnut!!	I love hazelnut smell in my coffee so I figure it will also be great to have it in a cup of hot chocolate. Unfortunately this product doesn't give me a strong hazelnut feeling, just a little. Well it is still a good one.	0	0

		A10TYGME2FQHO7	A healthier option, but not great	"There's something off about the pasta. While much closer to the regular pasta than Whole Wheat, which is way to grainy, the pasta here tends to kind of fall apart (only way I can describe it). But from a health aspect its better than normal blue box mac and cheese. And the taste is comparable.<br /><br />I know this sounds horrible and a total waste of cash, but occationally I'll buy this, toss the pasta and replace it with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00135XQCK"">Barilla Plus Penna Pasta~2pk~14.5oz Boxes~</a> which is 1000 times tastier than the pasta in this box, suffers none of the high grain of whole wheat, and is chock full of protein and Omega 3's, and overall healthier and more sustaining --  because its got protein.<br /><br />I keep wishing Kraft would just start selling the packets of cheese powder without the pasta (they do actaully <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1T6I"">Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Topper, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 8)</a>but its currently more expensive than just buying the box and tossing the pasta)."	1	1

		A3VIMB8ETZSZH0	Good taste, bad product	I enjoyed these k-cups when I used them. They tasted pretty good. However, I quickly noticed that my Keurig brewer began to have problems after I started using these and other Grove Square k-cups. Even when I would brew other cups, I would get half-brewed cups of coffee, smaller cups, and other issues. I cleaned the brewer, following all the instructions and tips in the manual. The issues came up again as soon as I used these k-cups. What I discovered is that the Grove Square k-cups were gunking up my brewer badly. I had to clean out every part of the brewer completely, including the brewer basket area, the water reservoir, and the internal mechanism. After completing the entire cleaning process two more times my brewer got back to normal. I won't order any Grove Square products again.	2	1

		A5TA976XI54JI	Savings = How much?	Oatmeal is a great food. I question the supposed suggested savings being offered.<br />Since when did a canister of Oatmeal cost $35?<br /><br />That is what Amazon is saying the list price is.<br />In reality the average price is $3 to $5.<br />In fact, at this writing, Amazon actually lists a single 18oz canister as being available for $3.89<br />see  http://www.amazon.com/Quaker-Old-Fashioned-Oats-18/dp/B005GD36O8<br /><br />Using that price you actually save only $2.76  or 11.8% vs the 90% claimed.<br /><br />I don't know, perhaps Amazon is including shipping costs when they calculate the savings. However, since your local grocer includes shipping in it's advertised price, if you have to pay shipping, it's probably cheaper to go to your local grocer.<br /><br />Again, Oatmeal is great.<br />Amazon is fantastic.<br />Price is fair.<br />Just don't believe the savings claim on this product (or from what I've seen - other food products).<br /><br />Use the Trust but Verify method when shopping for anything online.	6	1

		A3DV0I18XZ8Z86	Great for the price	"I've been buying this popcorn on the subscription program for the last 1.5 years. Overall, the kids absolutely love the popcorn - it tastes even better than the movies and for under $1.00 per bag, I figure I'm getting a good deal. However, one issue I have is the large number of ""Old Maid"" unpopped kernels. I haven't used other brands, so I'm not sure what is normal, but it seems that about 20% of the kernels do not pop. This is an average over 1.5 years of using the Great Northern brand in a Great Northern popcorn machine.<br /><br />If you have found a popcorn that makes a higher % of the kernels, you may want to avoid this brand, unless of course, it costs 25% more $."	0	0
		ARN85DCNU1YE4	Quite the workout - but maybe a bit too difficult	"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 2:01 Mins<br /><br /></span>This video shows Taxi (soft coated wheaten terrier) opening and playing with his Christmas/10th Birthday present... a Tug-a-Jug. He's played with it a few times now and he still doesn't get that he needs to pull the cord to get the treats to come out -- although he really enjoys knocking it around until the treats accidentally fall out. I bought the large size after reading the reviews because of the cord. The large size had the plastic cord which is easier to clean. The smaller size has the rope cord. Taxi is not a big chewer, so I felt comfortable that this toy would durable - and it is. I filled it with stinky treats which he can smell through both ends... but those treats upset his tummy a bit, so I'm going to have to try something else. I couldn't find the ingredients of the treats that are sold with the Tug-a-Jug, so I didn't buy those."	0	0
		A1J5HO2AMC1R77	NOT Macaroni and Cheese	I thought this would be a good gluten free replacement for Annie's mac n' cheese, but this was not really macaroni and cheese. The sauce was not smooth and was spicy (not hot-spicy, but strong-flavored spicy). My kids were appalled by it and while my husband and I could eat it, we didn't really like it. Since I bought a case, we threw away the rest of the spice packets and made our own cheese blend for the rest of the pasta. I would suggest trying one bag from a local store first if you can, otherwise be aware that you may just be buying expensive pasta with useless spice packets if your family doesn't like this unusual flavor.	3	1

		A2DJCXHZSGVAT6	Great product at the right price	"One of my favorite salad recipes I make often calls for walnut oil.  I bought a small bottle from a local major grocery store and it was over $10 for about 6 ounces.  Steep!  I love walnuts so naturally I loved this oil from my very first taste.  But the price was not right so I searched on the Internet and found this.  I was a little reluctant to buy 3 cans as I thought they go rancid before I can finish but I am now on my last can.  I use it in place of EVOO to make other vinaigrettes too.  Or just splash this walnut oil and my favorite raspberry vinegar and B&S (or seasons salt like Krazy Salt) over spring mix, it is an easy but great green salad! I do this a lot when I need a quick side. Anyway, this oil goes well with anything and it does not taste too nutty.  Just a touch of nice walnut flavor (of course, I love walnuts so even if it tastes very ""walnutty,"" I would still like it!)<br /><br />Anyway, it is a great product and I will buy the same pack again!"	0	0
		A3DVMDRZ0KOEXZ	Grainy and a Little Oily but Thick	I've read other reviewers comment on the calorie content of this flavor and it must be high because when I was trying to wash the dish I served it in in was quite oily.

This is the first one that he doesn't like.  When I first opened the can, it smells like green apple candy.  However, the taste does not have any apple flavor, or even ""grain-flavor"" like the other cereals but a little weird/chemical tasting; not exactly sure how to describe it.<br /><br />Back to Gerber & EB for my son..."	2	0
		AAF3ECYTDXIA7	Spicy Mustard	I have tasted one too many different mustards which claim to be spicy, but fall short.  This spreads easy and is neither too thick, nor too thin.  It actually does have enough heat to taste, without being excessive.  This mustard would make a great addition to any sauces, marinades, salad dressings, or just for dipping!  I would recommend this product, for anyone who is looking for a mustard with some true heat.	0	0
		A3T8J8FZ6R8B3W	Good product - better price elsewhere	This is a cute product to use in place of sprinkles - the bright colors of candy coating look great, and the chocolate center keeps them from being overly sweet.<br /><br />However this price is roughly double what you pay at Michael's (or Marshall's, when they stock stuff like this). Plus you can get the same product but in a 16 oz bag on Amazon here: http://www.amazon.com/CK-Products-Rainbow-Candy-Coated/dp/B00375LAO0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=home-garden&qid=1300131716&sr=1-1.

		A1Q92OGDGK6UUV	If You Really, Really Need the Low Acid, Then This is Pretty Good	If you are expecting the x-bold, smokey, gourmet flavor of a Starbucks or Seattle's Best, you may be reaching for a miracle that isn't there. I grew up in the 60s with a younger brother who needed to use sacchrine on everything because of his diabetes. Sacchrine is absolutely no sugar substitute. Anyone who has used it knows.<br /><br />The Puroast Low Acid is really not a bad alternative if you need a low acid blend because of acid reflux, sensitive stomachs, etc. Was it weaker than what we're used to? Certainly. Is it bolder than, say, Folgers medium roast. I would say that it is. Though milder than most bold roasts (that's a dead giveaway in opening the pouch. But that is probably because of its finer grind than even the mild and medium roasts with a coarser mill. The finer the grind, the lower the aroma retention. Yet, because it is a finer grind, the taste is much bolder than the smell would give away.<br /><br />This is also a smoother tasting French roast than I was expecting (possibly because of its fine grind), but it was a very pleasant taste.<br /><br />The cost and the flavor may be inconsequential to those who do really need a low acid coffee. For that reason, it was hard for me to rate using the star system because I am a coffee lover without a low acid need. Perhaps someone with a low acid need finds that this coffee is superb and would otherwise give it four or five stars.  If you are a regular coffee drinker, any flavor that isn't cultivated in what you are used to will make others, especially weaker blends seem more inferior than they probably are in reality. When I was in Asia, there were times when I would go weeks without a cup of coffee, and after that, the mildest of blends tasted oh so good to me.<br /><br />Although I was unable to try it in an espresso machine, the finer grind lends itself to espresso; and that may be something you might want to try with this blend to kick the flavor up another bold notch or two.<br /><br />Another possible idea is to use this blend in a French Press (yes, although I know the finer grind isn't typically conducive to the Press; perhaps a filter may be used).<br /><br />If you suffer from acid reflux, sensitive stomach, etc., this may be very worth the try for you.<br /><br />If you don't need the low acid beverage, stick with your standard brands.	0	0
		ANKQGTXHREOI5	Nutritious but...	I do have to say that the cat food is quite nutritious and appealed to my cat's sense of smell as well as my visual sense.  He also did not throw up this food, which is a rarity for my sensitive-stomached cat.  On the downside, he didn't eat much of it, either.  I don't know what about it didn't interest him beyond a few bites, but most of it got left in his bowl.  My dog, on the other hand, loves it!  I give three stars because it's potentially interesting to other cats, but mine wouldn't eat more than a little bit of it.  I gave some to a friend, and her cats loved it.	0	0
		A1Z3KFIFXC2H08	Sesmark Sesame  Rice Thins	The product is a known value to us and is fresh. The physical condition of the  product leaves something to be desired. The individual wafers are often broken up, to the extent of 30% of the contents of the package. This indicates careless packing for the rigors of package shipment. The use of a somewhat larger outside box with the air bag padding on all sides should be better for the physical care of the contents. My wife eats the thins for lunch very often with meat, cheese or fish and finds the broken ones unsatisfactory.	0	0
		A34BIRH4PZ4AD	Great Alternate for Baby Formula!!	My son is sensitive to cows milk protein and I am trying to keep him off of soy.  My milk was not enough for him, and I did not like the ingredients in baby formula (all had soy and most have cows milk protein, not to mention 45% corn syrup solids).  My pediatrician recommended this powdered goats milk because they add folate (not normally found in goats milk).  Since I have been feeding my son this milk, he has been SO happy and growing so much better! Have not had to add any vitamins/supplements to it to make it a whole food, it is fine on its own. Although, I have been using organic brown rice cereal because he is getting close to being ready for solids.  LOVE this milk! (always consult your doctor before changing your babies diet)	6	0
		A30IP3E4MDQ36	Taster then soda, but still full of sugar...	This stuff tastes awesome! And for once in a kiwi/berry drink you can taste the kiwi, I'd be very hard pressed to tell the difference between this and a traditional soda.<br /><br />I also like the fact that it's in a tall and slender can, fits in the fridge better and you can't mistake it for that pesky regular soda... :)<br /><br />However I would not say that this would be a better alternative to soda based on the fact that it still has a solid 33g of sugar. Yes it is better for you because it is made with 100% real juice instead of corn syrup, which I definitely like, but it's no different then drinking the 100% frozen juice from concentrate.<br /><br />Overall I really like the product and will probably buy some to have as an alternative to soda (for those few times a year).<br /><br />Pros:<br />You can actually taste the kiwi and the berries.<br />100% REAL juice, no artificial flavoring.<br />Very carbonated, not the least bit flat.<br />Quenches your thirst and is refreshing.<br />NO CORN SYRUP!!!<br /><br />Cons:<br />Spendy.<br />Although it is all natural, still contains 33g of sugar...<br />135 calories a can (ouch!).	2	0

		A37ERQQJ71PT9T	Defective seal	The coffee had a nice bold, flavor, but the foil on the cups were not properly sealed, and I mean all of the cups. Every brewing left grounds in the cup and sometimes made a complete mess because the water wasn't going through the brew tip.  The flavor of the coffee was not enough to warrant a better rating because we get this product for convenience and easy clean up, as much as for the flavor.	0	0
		AE3VA4Y3D0RPS	Quality has gone downhill	I had been buying these treats for my cavachon for the past two years. He loved them.<br /><br />The last batch was of noticeably lower quality...dry and crunchy rather than moist and chewy. I don't know if this is due to the shift in manufacturing from the US to China or coincidental. In any event, I will not be buying these any more and have switched to other treats.<br /><br />Note, Amazon would not let me return this item, and I am within the 30 day purchase period. I'm not pleased.	1	0
		A1VEA16QFOG5VR	Best gluten-free substitute for bread ! ! ! And worth every penny!	I am so happy that Amazon got these back in so I could order my second case. I don't eat wheat, it packs the pounds on me around my middle. Most breads have wheat or if they are gluten free, they cost way too much.<br /><br />I have eaten all kinds of rice cakes. I have found that most will break apart if you're spreading a nut butter on them. Not these! Also there are generally 13 rice cakes in a pkg of round regular rice cakes... this package of rice cakes has 27 pieces in each bag. Also, it's much like consuming a slice of bread without the crusts and they are nice and thin so you don't eat too much of a good thing.<br /><br />Try these if you're dissatisfied with regular rice cakes or if you must have gluten free bread!! I don't believe you will be sorry and Amazon's price is so good and FREE shipping... though the box is sort of big, it's pretty light and stores easily away. I live alone and I'm on my next to last pkg from my first case and they are not at all stale. I stored them in my cool dark garage in their original cardboard box.<br /><br />Also they are made in Belgium if that helps anyone. The packaging is air tight and they come 12 pkgs in a box and are in the perfect sized box, and mine arrived without a sign of any damage and I have yet to find even a single cracked rice cake! They are rather neutral in their taste... I make a special butter spread that I like on them real well. You take equal parts of room temperature butter, olive oil and water and blend ingredients until smooth. You can refrigerate this, it sets up but doesn't get hard so it is always spreadable and tastes really good! I use organic butter, olive oil and filtered water, but you don't have. This spread is so good and I believe it's better for you than straight butter.<br /><br />Also, I only use one cake to make a single sided sandwich, as with any rice cake using two as you would two pieces of bread just doesn't seem to work as well. But a single sided sandwhich with these rice cakes is very enjoyable!<br /><br />Hope this helps you decide to try them. Everyone I've given some to, have had only good comments about them.	2	0

		AP1QKPCQPLJTJ	DO  NOT waste your  money  !!!!!!!!	I have thought about ordering this product for 2 years and finally did.<br />I had 11 inches of my colon removed 3 years ago due to diverticulosis.  I LOVE popcorn, but since my surgery I had been advised to not eat it, or eat it rarely due to the hulls.  I was NEVER more excited after I ordered this product.<br /><br />What I can honestly tell you is this products has is the same amount of hulls as the popcorn I buy at the grocery store for 1/4 the price.  The small white popcorn is tender, but the hulls are still there in high volume.  So I will NOT be eating it.<br /><br />Order at your own discretion.	0	0
		A24FZ5ALYDEIDS	Starchy Pumpkin	Unfortunately, this product was not enjoyable.

		A36LOFUR3U753Z	Too small, too hard to open	With no clear instructions on how to open and close the unit, the first few times are an act of frustration.  When I finally realized that if I grip with my thumb and forefinger over the clear plastic shield, about one third from it's bottom and squeeze the sides, the bottom lip pops out nicely.<br />I will agree that this size is too small for most popular herbs like parsley, basil ect.  The company does now make a larger unit and it looks like it is more user friendly.<br />All in all I like it, I took away one star for the lack of instructions.<br /><br />3/2012: After a few months I have thrown this thing away.  It became increasingly harder to open and the size was just too small for the herbs I use most.  I have seen some newer, larger units that don't have the issue with opening it like this one has...I'm going to order one of these.<br /><br />I no longer recommend this unit and have lowered it to 2 stars.	2	0

		A2M0RGVSV6YCMZ	mediocre carbonated drink	While the flavor sounded good, kiwi berry, this is mostly an apple and grape juice based product. It is all natural, but it almost had an herb flavor, like I think of ginseng or something, though it was not included in the ingredients. The carbonation was about right and the flavor is sweet. I couldn't really distinguish the kiwi very strongly, and I wish I had been able to. It's not a bad drink and it is definitely better than many other options out there, but it's not one I'd seek out specifically, probably only buying if it were on sale.	0	1

		A20QDPC3E3WQI6	Sickening sweet	"This drink was sickeningly sweet (and I am a Mountain Dew addict, so I usually have no problem with sweet).  It was much like drinking snow cone flavoring straight from the bottle.  While it is all natural with no added sugar, it still has 140 calories in an 8.3 oz can.  A 16 oz can of Mountain Dew has 170 calories.  Definitely not a ""diet"" drink.  The only way I would recommend it is to keep away from high fructose corn syrup, but even then, at the price, it almost too expensive of an option."	0	0
		A1NGFGBX2VCQS8	Melitta, an also ran Coffee	I acquired this coffee through the Vine program.  I found the coffee to be just ok, with nothing to either recommend it or to take away from it. The package lists the grind as extra fine, but it is really just barely a fine grind with several larger pieces in it than you would not normally find in a fine grind.  This is not really an issue unless you really needed a fine grind.  It works just fine in a drip coffee maker with a paper filter.<br /><br />As for flavor, the coffee is not bitter, but does not have much of a personality.  I would compare it to MJB or any other mass marketed coffee on the store shelves.  This would probably be a fine coffee to use if you were going to add your own flavorings as there is nothing to get in the way of the flavorings that you would be adding.	0	0
		A2KUUWP4ZZMOBP	"Good quality, one of my ""go to"" flavored k-cups"	I don't drink a lot of flavored k-cups, but people have been raving about Wolfgang Puck's k-cups, so I gave this a try. It's definitely a good quality flavored coffee with a medium body. Overall, I have enjoyed several cups of this and have temporarily shelved my Timothy flavored k-cups in favor of this one. I sometimes add sugar free vanilla syrup, cream, and cinnamon. It's excellent that was in place of dessert. I also tried caramel syrup added to this... don't do it. It overwhelms the flavor.	5	0
		A1YU3SAW0XHQIY	Surprisingly Good.	Truthfully, I wasn't expecting too much with this, but thought I would give it a try for something different for my Keurig. I have to say, that I was pleasantly surprised at how good this is.  My favorite is the dark chocolate, but the peppermint is very good as well.  I am not a real milk chocolate fan, but I mixed it with some coffee for a mocha and it was very good. I would definitely purchase this again.	4	0

		A2BCDZO1XQLDH	A good option...	I enjoyed this drink. It has good fizz and flavor. Ingredients include apple/grade juices as the main fruit elements. Tangerine, orange and acerola (type of wild cherry) round out the other fruit juices. For my taste, this is not citrusy enough. I find an Orangina to have better flavor, but it is loaded with added sugars (high fructose corn syrup is the second ingredient in Orangina)! I also compare this to the Izze version and the Izze wins for flavor. I think the health benefits of The Switch or Izze drinks outweigh the flavor differences though, and if I was but one of these types of drinks, I would not look at Orangina again.	0	0
		A618BKNYH6AQC	just works	"My wife bought me this for storing fresh herbs and despite initial skepticism I gave it a try. It seemed to work well enough for basil, even freshening up some wilted leaves... but the ""seal the deal"" moment was when I put some fresh thyme in it and put it in the back of my refrigerator where I mostly forgot about it. 6 weeks later (we were gone for 2 weeks on vacation) I opened it and the thyme was as fresh as the day it was cut. I doubt it would sustain all greens for this long but the fact that it kept thyme fresh for over a month longer than a plastic bag in the produce drawer would have made this an easy $10 to justify.<br /><br />It's always a nice surprise when a kitchen gadget delivers the goods."	1	0

The ones I ordered arrived as furry, rancid walnuts. Unfortunately, I dumped the first cannister into my existing walnut storage without looking (since the packaging was in date). This caused me to have to throw away about 2 pounds of good walnuts because they were touched by these rancid ones. (Perhaps buying food online isn't the best idea...)	1	0

		A1XEJRNQSZPWAI	Chili Lime Flavor Review	I love Pop Chips. Parmesan Garlic and Sour Cream and Onion Pop Chips rock my world. They taste great, have a quirky crunch and are low cal/fat (in relation to traditional chips).<br /><br />Sadly though I must base this review on the Chili Lime flavor I was sent through the Amazon Vine program. These are probably my least favorite flavor to date. They have the lime twang you would expect and a little chili heat (though not overly spicy) and even the potato flavor comes through. Individually these all work but somehow in this chip they really don't. Interestingly enough the aftertaste is actually better than the intial flavor of the chip itself.<br />I'm not saying this flavor is bad, it's just not that good.<br /><br />Overall, great brand with great flavors in general but Chili Lime doesn't stack up against the others.	2	0
		AW23J9DDCZBW4	Good, but mine got moldy	These have good flavor. Plenty of other reviews address that. I also like the thick zipper bag they came in. My only real issue with these is that mine grew mold. I've never had vanilla beans do that before. These seemed unusually moist, so maybe that contributed to the issue. It started as a small spot, but grew so that it was on the ends of most of the beans. I finally got them all out, trimmed off the moldy bits, and froze what was left.<br /><br />It took 2-3 months for the mold to start, so if you use them quickly maybe that won't be a problem. But, I don't go through them that fast. I've had beans dry out in the past, but this is the first I've seen of mold. If you don't plan to use them within 2 months or so, I recommend keeping them in a fridge, freezer or coming up with some other way to stop the mold before it starts.	0	0
		AAKOCT2HJRWW0	Both my cats threw up after eating this!	My cats are not picky eaters, and lick their bowls clean of virtually anything i feed them (wellness, fussie cat, fancy feast, bff). I tried feeding them Tiki Cat on 2 separate occasions, and my cats threw up both times. I thought they may have gotten sick the first time from eating something off the floor, but when it happened a second time I was certain it was the Tiki Cat. I'm not sure if I received a bad batch, but I will certainly never be purchasing a Tiki Cat product again.	1	0

		A253I4TW0DTHLC	A good try...	I liked it but I didn't love it. It didn't have a strong flavor and it didn't seem rich. I usually drink Starbucks decaf French Roast and compared to this it seemed somewhat bland. But it wasn't bitter, and I could definitely tell it was low-acid, which is a great idea. I hope this company will keep trying to make some improvements to the formula, to give it more flavor. I very much appreciate their efforts.

		A1QIXPV1XB7GL4	Same great cookie in a smaller size	I live in the area where these cookies are made, and I remember buying them from local coffee stands when they first started making them years ago -- each one was wrapped in saran wrap and had a handwritten label on them.  The packaging has changed, and there are many different flavors available now, but the original breakfast cookie still tastes just as good today as those first ones did.<br /><br />The smaller size is great for a snack, as the large ones are enough for two people!

		A3FKGKUCI3DG9U	If it looks good, is it good for the cats?	"My two traditional striped cats eat mostly dry Science Diet cat food with a few NuCat vitamins added.  They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.  Brownie prefers the dry food but will eat some canned food only when the can is freshly opened.  Pi likes both.  We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.  A 1995 study in Japan found that cats that ate tuna had a higher concentration of mercury in their fur than cats that ate dry cat food.  The study and its results are discussed in an article that you can find on the web by using the search term ""all about tuna fish"".  I posted a question on the Petite Cuisine web site as to whether they had tested their products for mercury.  I have not received an answer.

		A3GASQRWPQW28W	A Decent Decaf ...	"First off, I received a bag of this coffee via the Vine Program to review at no cost.  Secondly, I am more of a bold, ""slap-me-in-the-face"" French Roast coffee drinker (or StarBucks Gold Coast), so I had my reservations about this decaf.<br /><br />And ... Well, for me, this coffee had a somewhat stale aroma upon opening the package, an OK flavor once brewed (sort of a nutty strange flavor at first), and once consumed, left an after-taste in my mouth.<br /><br />It is definitely a different roast than I am used to, but it is ""decent"" for a pre-ground Melita decaf.  More of a medium roast as opposed to being a dark bold roast in my opinion.  Overall ... not too bad.<br /><br />I give this coffee a so-so recommendation."	1	3
		A1RQQ2HWUGEUWA	NOT what I originally ordered! BOO, amazon!	"As another reviewer stated, many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder- from alive and aware, ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder. That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed.<br />I am really confused/irritated how my review for ""alive and aware raw cacao"" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can't they just say ""out of stock"" or ""currently unavailable"" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around?<br />Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao.<br />I did recently order alive and aware's raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand.<br />Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the ""brands"" and ""vendors"" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said ""alive and aware"" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.<br /><br />For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I'm going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)<br /><br />I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.<br /><br />Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!!<br />I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food ""of the Gods"" (theobroma) as they say :)<br />My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!!<br />Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw.<br />Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!  PEACE be with You!"	3	0
		AOQUFU3CHF3EP	no salty taste	I was recently told I needed to reduce salt for health reasons and I was so haapy to get the Table Tasty and try it. There is a dash of mixture of vegetable taste , however no salt taste. I was very dissappointed.	1	1
		A2XPGNJ8YUPHM0	Even cats love it...	Note that I'm not recommending you feed your cat dog food on any kind of regular basis: the two types of animals generally need different kinds of foods and nutrients. However, at the time I was having trouble finding cat-specific dehydrated food that I thought my cats would tolerate, and this was the one dehydrated food I found that included a high amount of protein *and* specifically mentioned taurine on the label, which cats need, so I decided to use it temporarily. The cats absolutely adore it. I've since found a cat-specific flavor from the same company, but I'll probably use a little of this now and then as variety.<br /><br />The cats' coats look and feel shiny and healthy, and they definitely vomit less than when fed more mainstream foods. I also mixed it with some straight ground raw meat/organs/bone to make sure they were getting plenty of meat. The wild brushtail certainly seems to agree with them as a protein source, and there are precious few protein sources that don't make them sick (I'm limited to chicken, turkey, rabbit, and a small amount of fish usually). Because the brushtail is wild it isn't grain fed, and thus should have plenty of the right nutrients. Also, according to the company, it's an overpopulated nuisance pest, so this is a responsible way to help conserve the forests brushtail devour and the animals that live there. What's not to love?	0	0
		A3JFOFWUTJSWI1	NOW foods organic quinoa is great	I had been looking for an affordable priced quinoa since it is pretty expensive in my store. I noticed Amamzon.com had a sale on quinoa and took a chance on buying it since we had never tried it before. The NOW brand of quinoa is organic which is a HUGE plus. The grains are pretty clean already but I still rinse before using. The qunioa is great, so very healthy and cooks in around 20 minutes (even though the pacakge states 15 minutes). I will be definitly be buying this brand again from Amazon.com as it arrived in excellent condition within 5 days.<br /><br />If you are thinking about trying/buying quinoa, I highly recommend the NOW organic quinoa.	6	0
		A2KJ8U6RVOAJ8Q	Tully's Italian Roast outdated	"I love Tully's Italian Roast. It is my favorite of all the robust coffees available. I bought this 50 pack and when it arrived there was a note that it was ""outdated."" I was given the opportunity to return it for a refund, but I don't have time to fool around with returns unless absolutely necessary.  This coffee was good enough to keep, but no where as good as it usually is. The coffee is excellent, but the company from whom I purchased this should have not sent me outdated coffee. Obviously, I will never by from this company. I will, however, continue to buy good Tully's Italian Roast."	2	0

		A1KNF8V0TT4LW2	Rich, thick cocoa.  Surprisingly good!	"Ordered on a whim.  My first ""Grove Square"" purchase.  Great for the family's occasional cocoa desire.  Being a K-Cup it's fast and easy.  Was a little worried the cocoa might leave some after taste in my coffee, so far so good.  Great cup of dark, rich cocoa.  Maybe could taste a LITTLE better if it was from a gourmet brand you mix yourself with steamed milk.  The ease and simplicity, and lack of clean up, make this a better option for me.  Will order again.  Nice to see it on subscribe and save."	10	0

		A35R32TA60XD57	Expensive, but worth it!	"I have been finding quality food for one of my kitties who has developed an allergy to chicken.  I hesitated on this brand because of the price, but then when I saw how limited my choices were I broke down and ordered a few of the flavors.  I have to say I am very pleased with the quality.  I also ordered some Evo venison and duck as well as the Natural Balance limited ingredients venison with peas and the duck with peas.  Neither of those COMPARE to this brand and my cats testify to that as well as I do.  The texture is so much better and she loves these the most.  I have gotten her the rabbit, duck and venison and she eats them all with more relish that either Evo or Natural Balance.  I do have to say that of those lesser brands, the Natural Balance venison does have a nice texture and not as ""pasty"" as the duck with peas.  Mabel wasn't as crazy about it though, although she did eat it all but not with the same excitement as the Instinct brand.  When you are having a problem with a cat that can not or will not eat something, when you find something she will, it is worth it's weight in gold!  This brand is a keeper."	1	0

		AWOL2PTDJOLWK	Love Goats Milk	I love to feed my kids goats milk. But to buy it fresh from the farm is so expensive, so this is a great substitute.

		A2MV3M8QBSDIJI	Best food for your best friend	When I got my dog I did a lot of research regarding dog food and dog food ingredients. There are high quality dog foods like this one out there, but you probably won't find them in regular supermarkets. While this food may be more expensive than other dog foods, it is well worth it. Innova Evo is one of the foods that were NOT affected by the recall. Also, the ingredients are healthier, and don't have high wheat/grain content or nasty additives.<br /><br />My Doberman used to have a lot of dandruff and had some skin problems. Also her poop was really mushy, almost diarrhea. When I finally switched her to Innova Evo Red Meat I'd wished I'd done it sooner. She doesn't need to eat quite as much, and her coat is beautiful! No more dandruff problems and her skin is great.	3	0

One time she managed to unscrew the bottom, and with that experience, she fixated on the bottom as the ""ultimate solution"" for the last morsels that weren't coming out from tilting and dropping the toy.  She cracked through the hard plastic, breaking both the lid and the jug.  The toy is advertised for ""heavy chewers"" but the container obviously doesn't hold up.  I hope the store will offer a refund."	0	0
		A1N70L3O9587Q9	Terrible!	I bought a new bread machine and bought this collection of bread mixes as well as some single mixes to try it out.  The single mixes worked well as they included yeast packaged separately in the mix.  My machine states clearly not to get the yeast wet, to put it on top of the flour away from the water.  The mixes in this collection have the yeast in the flour, not packaged separately.  The bread failed to rise at all.  Why would they package the yeast separately in the single mixes and not in the multi packs?  Along with the Heartland Collection I also purchased the Baker's Choice Collection.  I am throwing them all out.  Don't waste your money.	1	1

		A3KPT4FF3J91W4	Hideous over-powering orange flavor	"Well, where to begin.<br /><br />First, I have been drinking tea (green, black, oolong, white, etc.) for more than 15 years as either loose leaf (whole leaf) or bagged. My number one love is green tea ... specifically Japanese Sencha. I have consumed many grades and types of steaming (mild, medium and ""deep""). I have also tried many of the products offered by ""Two Leaves and a Bud"" by way of Whole Foods (who do not offer this).<br /><br />This is the first offering by Two Leaves that I sadly have to say is dreadful. Before you think I'm a jerk, let me say that they offer some awesome bagged teas. This just isn't one of them (IMHO).<br /><br />The orange that they add KILLS all of the beauty that the Sencha could potentially offer. What's worse is they suggest a steeping time of 4-minutes. Ludicrous. Most mild steamed (which this is) or medium steamed Sencha's steep for no more than 3-minutes. Four minutes will produce an acrid bitter brew unless the Sencha is a superior grade (which this doesn't appear to be).<br /><br />Even after steeping this for about 3 minutes, the taste is still overwhelmingly sharp & ""bitty"" (just a weaker sharp). I can not believe that the people at Two Leaves have ever had a good cup of loose leaf Sencha. I can't. If they have, they wouldn't offer this.<br /><br />I can only assume they add so much orange to it because the Sencha grade is poor. Otherwise, why not sell it without the orange flavor like the wonderful <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGZKWM"">Two Leaves and a Bud, Tamayokucha Extremely Green Tea, Tea Bags, 100 Count</a> they offer? The Tamayokucha is excellent! No orange flavor needed, and I bet none is needed here either.<br /><br />Bummer is that I was dumb enough to buy the 100 count box (my bad). There is no way I can drink the rest of it and I would feel horrible if I gave it away to someone. They would think I had no taste in teas.<br /><br />My advice: buy a single box of this first. If you like it, switch to coffee."	1	1

I discovered it while at a pei wei someone had left a bottle of this laying out and I quick snapped a picture, took it to amazon and found it. It is great on pretty much everything, as previous users say.  I was also in a Thai restaurant the other night and they used the same sauce on an amazing salad.  Try this on a do it yourself salad consisting of sliced mangos, lettuce, onions, and red peppers.  Drench those ingredients in this stuff and everyone will think your a master chef.	0	0

		A3IDPOFLYNBRRY	Sweet Paprika - Good with Everything!!!	First of all, there are two kinds of paprika - sweet and hot.  Both are delicious but the Szeged sweet paprika is more versatile than the hot kind (which is also awesome!). I have been using this spice for years and the Hungarian type is consistently better than any other type/brand.  Use this on meat, veggies, cassaroles, salad, baked bries, quiches, egg dishes, shrimp, pretty much anything.  I use this in soup all winter long, especially with gulyas levas (this is a traditional Hungarian soup though it is often confused with goulash) and czipetke.<br /><br />This product is the large restaurant size, which is the only size to have if you do any amount of cooking because once you try this you will love it's versatility!!!!	1	0

Although it doesn't taste exactly like cheesecake, it's a pretty good cheesecake-like dessert for the price. I like to make the mini-cheesecakes suggested on the box and top them with fruit. One note of caution: Amazon's cost per box is a little high. In this pack of 12, each box of mix costs about $2.30, but a box costs around $1.80 in my local Target. So, I recommend this product, and I suggest buying it at a local store.	5	1
		A1PGOV3JXFJMP9	I know what your thinking and yes it works for that too	Basically these tables change the way you taste acidic things, they will instead taste sweet. Lemons taste like a strong lemonade. Some of you might be thinking, well that's fun and all but how would my lover taste? well, kind of sweet(men and women). Give it a try you'll see. My only complaint is that they made them look so much like a drug that I had to convince some of my more prudish friends that it was just ground fruit.	20	3
		ASHO96ZB8AL1Z	Not worth it.	My sister in law was up for a visit this weekend, so I thought it's be a perfect time to test out this coffee.  Neither of us were impressed.

		AQDFDAB8DN74Y	Unlisted ingredient of Baxter Lobster Bisque	This soup is very good tasting if you like seafood, like I do. I am finally finishing my case of cans, because it is good food. However, I do not plan on getting any more of this particular product because every can has a little something extra: bits and pieces of chitinous shell, mostly from the shrimp but also a few hard pieces now and then from the lobster. They are small pieces, which means taking small spoonfuls and not biting down hard on anything, and don't eat the last spoonful. I find six to eight pieces of this debris in each can. Like I said before, I am finishing the case, because it is food and pretty good at that. But I just don't appreciate having to be that careful with my soup.	1	0
		A1CFU5XJXN3PV4	"Tangy and Pleasingly ""Real"""	"After taking my first sip of Switch Orange/Tangerine, I raised a suspicious eyebrow because it didn't taste the way I expected it to. Then it dawned on me that my mouth was prepared for more of a fake, amped-up ""Orange"" soda, but what I was tasting was real, natural juice. Yes, I knew that from the label, but that's not the same as experiencing it.<br /><br />The taste was a nice blend of orange and tangerine, not too sweet, and the carbonation adds a nice touch. A bit like a non-alcoholic Mimosa cocktail.<br /><br />My only reservation is that the calorie count is (perhaps unavoidably) too high for me to drink this on a regular basis - though let me be quick to point out that this is a ""no sugar added"" product. For those who aren't counting calories, a nice refreshing ""Switch"" from soft drinks!"	0	0

It's lightly carbonated, which I like but too sweet for my taste (think strawberry candy). The mouth feel is quite round and it has some body too it. It's made from juice concentrates and carbonated water and there are 135 calories of sugar in the small 8 oz can. I wouldn't call it a healthy beverage and whether it's natural or not doesn't matter to me.	0	0
		A2GHF7NUPOGKAT	VERY STRONG.	"I should have known not to get the extra bold. This usually refers to the amount of coffee, but when I brewed it on the ""tall"" setting so that it is not so strong, it still was way too intense for my taste. I only ordered this blend because of the reviews, which I cannot really understand. I have to mix almost a half cup of almond milk to cut the bitterness. I will probably not buy this again.<br />Side Note: I only got this to use with my office keurig machine. At home, I use Equal Exchange Organic Coffee and it is WONDERFUL!"	0	0

		A3E9KEZ2XP7YWV	we will eat it however....	Give yourself the gift of buying the regular skippy.  Although this gives you less fat, there is a distinct taste difference.  We will eat what we purchased but I am still in disbelief that such a minimial amount of fat reduction in a product really makes a great PB turn into a yuckky PB...	1	0
		ADTPE897GR54J	The food is great, but the bag sucks	My cats loved the treats but everytime I try to use the bags zipper to close it up I gotta fiddle with it for a while just to close the bag. Eventually The bag didn't close properly and all the treats dried out causing the cats to lose interest. I plan to buy another but this time I will dump it in my own container.	0	0
		A3HHRSX7ESCP9B	Great Value	There are 4 kittens that started hanging outside the house and I started feeding them.  Rather than buying the smaller bags, this is a great value for multiple cats.

		A372X206KVOQWQ	Heavenly Action	This is the best caramel/chocolate combination I have ever tasted. The caramel is liquid and complements the Ghiradelli chocolate perfectly. Do not try this brew if you are attempting to lose weight - you will end up an addict like me.<br />  The Ghiradelli product is far better than the Caramello/Hershey product in every way. The Caramello chocolate lacks the refined taste of the Ghiradelli squares, and the Caramello caramel is harder and not as sublime in taste. Comparing the two is like comparing Warren Buffett to myself in terms of wealth. Unfortunately I am the Caramello bar in this regard.<br />  At the very least try the Ghiradelli.	0	0
		AXMBQBI7N8L37	TASTE GREAT	Very good hot cocoa.  And price was right<br /><br />Awesome and passing the word on the item.  Will buy it again	0	0
		A2S244KFX0745K	There is none greater.	The best chocolate in the world, in this critic's humble opinion, is made in the United States. And the best chocolate in the United States is made in California, by the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company. It is surely the best chocolate that one can find in so many stores, malls, etc. throughout the United States. Their actual stores are rare, but Kroger, Wal-Mart, Martin's (formerly Ukrops) and a long list of other grocery stores and many malls stock their products.<br /><br />I have never encountered milk chocolates with caramel filling to surpass the quality of these. These are chocolates deserving of poetry. You can eat them quickly, or take your time and savor every moment of eating every one. The choice is up to you.	3	0
		A1FUCVOWVV7NVO	Price versus taste don't add up	We didn't care for this product at all. It seemed to have a funny after taste to it. Wasn't worth the cost. We were unable to even finish using what we purchased it was that nasty.	0	2
		A3NVNHJ1SJW080	Bitter and acidic!	Got this k-cup in a selection that came with my new Keurig. I usually make the small, 6 oz. cup. The resulting brew was so bitter and acrid that is was undrinkable... not just bad. Thinking that I must have done something wrong I tried again.....this time making a 12 ouncer......absolutely no difference. It tasted distinctly burnt! I was very disappointed as I like strong coffee and, usually, Italian style roast is my favorite. I would give this one a pass.......	0	3
		A2H7CZLHBP0N3D	Tastes like cardboard!	I read about these on [...] and decided to try them.  I bought the variety pack so as not to get stuck with one flavor if I didn't like them.  I really tried to like these because of the health benefits but I ended up throwing out the whole case after tasting one of each flavor.  If you are looking for these as a substitute for potato chips, forget it.  They really do taste like dissolving cardboard.  Stick with baked Lays!	5	6

		A307ISA4AOH6D9	Not Into Sour Candies...	"Let me start by saying that I love Skittles and Starburst. I love to sprinkle Skittles in my pop-corn to get that sweet/salty/fruity/crunchy combination. And Starburst? Well, who needs to do anything but eat them! That being said, I think this particular assortment is a waste of my money because half the box is SOUR editions of both these candies. I do NOT enjoy sour ANYTHING and especially NOT my candy! Candies should be SWEET. Hence the saying; sweet as candy... I WON'T buy this again! I guess I should have read the description better, if it even says so...<br /><br />Okay, so went I back to check, and it DOES NOT state that this variety box contains half the contents in ""SOUR"". So I came back to edit my review and let others know that fact."	0	0
		A1CZLOI3W8E5JM	Just a tad too small for my wife's taste, but kids and I love it	Pops fully, few spare kernels with the traditional stovetop method.

		A3SC3T5GGVLRAS	SKIMPY for the price charged!!  Shocked!	"Was shocked at the skinny size of this item!! They are five inches long as I expected, because that's the size I wanted and ordered, but can't be any bigger around than even a pencil and that's a BIG stretch!! WOW, I'm sure disappointed considering the cost ~~ $7 and shipping. Won't be ordering these again.<br />  Of course my dog likes them ok, but wouldn't call them her fav by any means. :(  Will I send them back? Don't know if it's worth the hassle at this point. But I will NOT recommend them either. Because of the size quality and high price compared to so many other products to choose from!  Keep looking is my advice. :)<br />  The other Beefeaters' products I ordered well met my standards. This one was a DUD!!  What's the old saying?  Buyer beware?  I fell into that trap big time!<br />  Here's the product link at this time:<br /><br />  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00176AIDU"">Beefeaters Great Fillin Porkhide Rolls with Meaty Chicken Filling, 5-Inch</a><br /><br />  Wish you luck if you try this product...but again ""Buyer Beware!!""<br /><br />UPDATE 2.15.2012: My little dog got VERY SICK not too long after I wrote this review...I contacted Cust.

		A4UWWXUT9H0UJ	Doesnt work.	I have 2 chihuahua's and they are not at all interested in this toy.  I have tried different types of treats in it and they still care less.  Maybe it is a good toy for big dogs in a yard or something?	0	1
		A27YPCR3ZXWVFE	So Delicious...Yet my companions wont touch them.	Great chips, great price.  Odds are that you will have them to yourself.  If you like your fish and chips soaked in malt vinegar, you will love these.  The best salt and vinegar chips I have ever had (and I love this flavor, mind you).  They are spectacular with deli sandwiches or on their own.  Since I have found that S&V is palatable to only the most intelligent of our species I know that my afternoon snack is all mine, unless of course I run into another heavy brained, hearty breathed like mind.  -Summary- If you like the taste of bitter sweet salty vinegar and a crispy chip to boot you wont pucker at the sight of these handily bagged morsels.  It is the first and only time I have committed to a whole case of chips and I will do it again.  Mmmmm... vinegar...	1	1

		A3RHPBNP2N9RJB	Real Candy Cane Shavings In This!	This is the best candy cane cocoa, and it has real bits of candy cane. Don't worry, it's not totally sharp... Most of it dissolves in the liquid.<br /><br />I mix my cocoa with a battery operated frother, which uses every single bit of cocoa, so there is not a single bit of cocoa on the bottom.<br /><br />After, it's really a pepperminty cup of chocolate that is very lovely. Refreshing, I'd say.<br /><br />This is a must with milk, though I think you can do it with water... but milk is best to get the full flavor effect.	0	0
		A323R9LLM6DKDA	Best Thing About Kentucky!	Ale 8 is the best thing about Kentucky! It far exceeds any other Ginger Ale product on the market - both because of the delicious taste and because unlike most other Ginger Ale drinks it includes caffeine for that extra shot of energy.	0	0

		AFK4SSP559JQW	Great Gluten-free snack and healthy	I got these for my gf as she isn't supposed to eat any gluten.  All of the flavors taste great and they seem to be much healthier than regular potato chips.  If you are looking for a gluten-free snack, I highly recommend Popchips!	0	0

		A3R01WHD75L6FG	Dogs Find Bland	Both of my dogs, including the one that eats dirt off the floor, were unimpressed with these treats. The resealable bag is nice, but if the dogs don't eat the treat it isn't very helpful.<br /><br />If your dog does like these treats, it is convenient that they come in large wafers that are prescored to break in half for smaller dogs.	0	0
		A2NNV4PZF3FKQ6	Great healthy snack	Have tried many crackers, including some other Dr. Kracker, and think this tastes the BEST.  It's hard/crunchy with lots of seeds on it, so if that's an issue, it might not be for everyone.  Buying it in Amazon's 6-pack makes it less expensive than purchasing in the store.	1	0
		A1ASD6B9ZDLDEE	Works great with Microwave Popper	I ordered this popping corn after being disappointed with the local big box store selection-two brands.  One of them tasted chalky like styrofoam and its claim was larger popped kernels.  No taste.<br /><br />I mainly use this popcorn with one of those plastic microwave popping bowls.  I noticed that 1/3 cup yields more cooked popcorn than two other brands I have tried.  It kept on popping after my usual 2 minute and 20 second routine.  When using microwave poppers, you tend to get some burnt kernels if you extend the cooking time for maximum popped corn.  The snappy burnt kernels didn't taste as bad as other brands.<br /><br />This white popcorn tasted great with canola oil and even better when popped with coconut oil.	0	0
		A15XG2PBR6KC5B	Good & Bad	"The good:<br /> - Good taste;<br /> - Pops up plump;<br /> - Convenient.<br /><br />The bad:<br /> - Lots of unpopped kernels (far more than any other brand I've used). You get plenty of popped corn, but it seems a waste and could lead you to question freshness or quality of the corn;<br /> - Uses the coal tar dyes Yellow #5 and #6 which have been implicated in various health issues and are listed as Group I carcinogens by the IARC.<br /> - The generic term ""natural and artificial color"" is used rather than listing actual flavor contents.<br /> - No ""best by"" or expiration date on the package<br /><br />For me the bad will prevent me from ordering more of this otherwise good popcorn. I don't need questionable additives just to make my popcorn yellow, and it leaves a colorful gross residue in the pan after popping. And for flavor, if the popcorn itself, along with whatever I want to add on my own, can't carry the day, I will find a product that can stand on its own.<br /><br />Other:  You only need 4 oz, or half this bag, to completely fill a standard Whirley-Pop so you can cut back as needed. Very salty for my taste, so you may want to start with much less than the salt offered and then salt to taste till you find the amount that works for you."	3	2
		A1JXDNYYEAABFO	Not as good as the Newman's Own Mints in the tins	I really enjoy all the flavors of Newman's Own Mints, and I thought I would try the rolls for a change.  Yes, the rolls are less expensive, but they do not have the same consistency or mouth feel as the mints of the same flavor that are sold in tins.  Also, the mints in tins do seem to last longer, so I wonder if these rolls (though convenient) are even a better bargain.  I would not purchase these again; rather, I will spring for a few extra dollars and continue to purchase the Newman's Own Mints in tins.	0	0
		A35TRUGBY8NNBI	Bright flavor, smooth on the palate	I tasted this Matcha from Rishi the first time today. The flavor is bright, assertive and fresh. It mixes nicely into both hot and cold liquids, leaving no clumps of tea at the bottom of my glass after it was whisked. The tea powder is fine, giving it smoothness, no grittiness or grainy feel. I had it both in water and with milk; in both the flavor was not muddied. The flavor is more intense (bold) than most Matcha I've had, making others seem bland by comparison. Nothing off-putting, just seems more concentrated. It has a good crisp green color, and each packet holds about one tablespoon of Matcha. I am glad this order was for a pack of 2 because I can see myself going through one box quickly.	9	0
		A1EZGLNIKUY79I	Not for the MSG-Sensitive	Although the description states that the salt-free version of Cavender's contains no msg, BEWARE. I sprinkled a little of this on beef last night while cooking it, and my intestines are still talking back to me 12 hours later! 'Flavor base seasoning' and 'five other spices' are both mystery ingredients in this mixture, that probably contain msg. NOT FOR MSG SENSITIVE PEOPLE!	4	2
		A2HPVNZZF15W93	Sure was hoping....	Low acid or not, I'm sorry, I just couldn't get past the taste. I tried it black and w/ additives - sugar, coffee-mate, etc..I had to draw the line at artificial sweeteners; they make everything taste worse... The brewing aroma was mild to nearly nothing --  depending on the strength it was brewed. Well, it looks like I'm stuck w/ decaf during the work week until someone finds a low acid, great tasting coffee...	2	0
		A1XYZXQUJQIFU3	it's aight.	"I bought this water when i was at college for the first week. I felt bad using my roommate's water all the time and i was 7 states away from home. So i ordered this water. It was delicious, but the only complaint i have is that the bottles were REALLY...well...plastic-y. I felt really un-green drinking water out of these HUGE plastic bottles.<br /><br />So now, i just ask my roommate to buy water for me when she goes home on the weekends. I give her $ 4, she runs to walmart and gets me 2 cases of 30 water bottles. Yay me!<br /><br />Sometimes i still think about this water, longing for it as i sip my coffee or tea or ramen-juice and say to myself ""This would be so much better with talking rain.""<br /><br />Its one college student's battle between deliciousness and eco-friendliness."	2	5
		A5EK01Z5TAWOT	BIG mistake	i just received  my cans and should have listened to the reviews. i tried to be positive and go with the reviews who received the cans in perfect shape. what a mistake. ALL but 2 cans were severely dented. the other 2 still had dents. i don't think i could open them if i tried, but i would be afraid to eat the product anyway. i will not pay to send them back. they were wrapped well in bubble wrap so they weren't damaged in transit. they were sent out with the sender KNOWINGLY sending imperfect cans. they should be ashamed of themselves, and if they want them back they should pay for the shipping!  i WILL not be taken in again. i want my money back. this is the FIRST item from amazon i have not been happy with.	13	3

		A141INO5311NA	Very strong coffee, burnt-tasting.	I'm not sure most American coffee drinkers would go for this. I tried it several times at varying strengths, and even using half what I normally use, it tasted way too strong and burnt. It has very little complexity--whatever is there is drowned in the harsh burnt taste that reminds me of mud for some reason. I don't have an issue with regular coffee though I did once have trouble with acid reflux; I didn't notice much difference in acidity levels and the sheer overwhelming strength of the coffee gave me a stomachache that normal coffee doesn't.<br /><br />I understand that some foreign drinkers might like this and suspect that's the market the manufacturer is going for. I gave two stars because some people might actually really like that strong taste in their coffee. I don't think it's bad coffee, just really really strong. It makes me wonder what their normal roasts and blends might taste like.	0	0
		A32L0PTBX96Q9F	Pretty good, but doesn't hold my dog's interest	My Westie liked this at first, but it didn't really hold his interest.  Plus, you have to fill the bottle about half full.  He gets bored after removing a few items, and then you either have to waste the food by replacing it with smellier food, or just leave it sitting around.  I think I just need to try with food he enjoys more, but I wanted the point to be that he would eat his regular food from this toy.	0	0

		AU82LJJJ1KYXX	Grounds for not ordering again	I love the taste of this coffee but in my last order of four boxes about every other K-cup has a tear or rip in the internal filter and thus the grounds flow through into the cup of coffee which wastes the value of the coffee as drinkable.  Wolfgang needs to correct this flaw in packaging.  I will not order again because of the waste.	0	0
		A2ZKLDWOZ2TNZG	Don't waste your money	These reviews are all from sometime ago, and perhaps what was said was true at that time. But let me warn anyone looking for some good Rwandan coffee right now, do not waste your money. I have tasted true good Rwandan coffee, which is very similar to Kenyan coffee. Most African coffees taste naturally citrus sweet. I don't know what was in the bag I got. The aroma was terrible (like the beans had partially absorbed some odd flavor from something else) and it tasted just the same. I had to toss the 3 pound bag.	3	0
		A2QFO64UAU5N18	Quick to ship and tasty	"I've been looking for a long time for a beer sausage that was hot to the taste that I use to enjoy back in the Deep South when I was a kid growing up. So far, I've not been able to find the sausage that rang my bell. These arrived quickly and they are tasty and I am glad that I did order these, however, they are not as good as the ones I use to eat when I was in my teens.<br /><br />I gave the product a 3 star rating because they were tasty, but not what I was expecting. I know many of you will enjoy these and you'll probably rate these as a 5 star item, but I must be honest to provide the best rating possible. The 3 stars were for the lack of qualilty in taste. They are not ""hot"" as one is led to believe. Hot makes you sweat, these do not."	0	0

		AST715OJDJXLD	Pretty Fun!!	We found these tablets to be pretty fun! I suggest dissolving a full tablet in your mouth, not cutting it in half as others suggested. And definitely be sure to move the tablet around your ENTIRE tongue...I missed the back of my tongue when dissolving the tablet so whenever I'd swallow I'd get a hint of the real flavor.<br /><br />However, it was definitely neat to see how the tablet changes your taste!! We tried lemons, limes, grapefruit, buffalo wing flavored potato chips, sour patch kids, warhead sour spray, dill pickles, oranges, whiskey, and wine. I found the ruby red grapefruit to be absolutely AMAZING. The dill pickles tasted so much like sweet pickles, I had to double check the jar to make sure they weren't! Pinot grigio was particularly delicious, as the tablet cut through the sour-ness turning it super sweet!!<br /><br />Oranges were okay, just tasted a little sweeter than normal. The lemons were still a bit sour but I found myself eating 4 slices of them, which I don't think I could have done without the tablets! I swear, the ruby red grapefruit was by far the best, in my opinion.<br /><br />We found that the more sour a food, the more drastic an effect. I definitely recommend trying these tablets with a full fridge so you can experience all types of foods! I'd say some grapefruit, lemons, and dill pickles are a must to try with these.<br /><br />They're great to try with friends, as the novelty wears off after one or two tries. As long as there are new people around though, it's fun to see other reactions to the tablets. Definitely recommend!!	1	0

		A2Z08HK9D6ZPR3	Indigestion!	Tried this by adding the tomato paste, diced tomatoes and ground turkey.  We normally make turkey chili from scratch and love it.  This, however, was NOT good.  Ended up popping tums.  Watch out - - too much garlic.	1	2
		A11LJJL1SOH6W0	My daughter's favorite jarred food	My 7-1/2 month old absolutely loves this one...by far, it is her favorite jarred baby food. I like it because the lentils add a bit more protein than your average baby food, and I'm not ready to introduce her to meats yet.<br /><br />I do subscribe & save, which brings the price down to $0.80/jar. That's a fair price - not an amazing deal, but roughly equivalent to sale prices at the grocery store.  The bigger issue is that this particular blend is hard to find - I have to go to Whole Foods. My regular grocery store and Target carry Earth's Best, but not this blend. My daughter likes it so much, though, that I would still buy even if the price were a bit higher than store prices. It's a good one!	0	0
		A1JL5ZJYDBNY9V	Wish they hadn't changed this toy	I originally purchased this item back in March of last year.  It worked out great with my yellow lab in dispensing a meal a day.  This version of the toy had an actual rope coming out of the jug.  After about half a year, the rope wore through, but given the low price of the toy, I was satisfied with 6 months of heavy use and recommended it to friends.<br /><br />I then purchased a replacement end of last year.  Unfortunately, the manufacturers had changed the toy so now it's a rubber rope in place of the original fiber one.  This toy lasted about 15 minutes before my dog had completely chewed through it, making the toy nearly useless.<br /><br />5 stars for the original version, 1 for new and unimproved.	3	2

		A2SU6CA6HSK85I	Delicious	"Like Izze, the basic idea here is soda made with actual fruit juice. No sugar, no HFCS, no preservatives, no coloring; just 100% fruit juice concentrate and sparkling water. Fruits listed are apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola (whatever that is).<br /><br />Intriguingly, the can mentions ""contains soy"" at the end of the ingredients list. There's no protein content listed, so it must be a trace amount. Something to bear in mind if you have a soy allergy, however.<br /><br />Flavor is fantastic. I'd have a hard time choosing between it and Izze, but I think I might just give Switch the edge."	0	0
		A1J4147VIML9Y4	Worth The Money!	These chips might seem a little expensive compared to other leading (and unhealthy I might add)chips, but I was not disappointed in my purchase. They arrived in a few days and made the perfect snack for me and my husband's lunches. Also, we checked for the closest store selling these and it was Target 50 miles away in Tulsa and would have been costly to buy them as they are more per case and the drive to get them.	0	0
		A2L7M1TT7T843O	So good!	I think this is a love it or hate it kind of coffee.  I love it.  The flavor starts out similar to butter toffee, but then sort of morphs into coconut, pineapple, and rum.  I think it's delicious and unique, and I don't ever want to be without some in my cupboard.	2	0

They claim that the fondant can be rolled out thinner then most brands, so you can use less to decorate more. That is not true. Even just rolling it out to 1/8in it tends to tear. Once I finally got it on the cake to cover, it is very hard to smooth it around the cake. It is very sticky, the fondant smoother does not glide smoothly over it. All in all I will never buy this brand again, I am going to stick with Wilton.	1	2
		A1BT9KYMI6RMN4	Love it but.......	I really like this tea!  It has great flavor and is really easy to make.  I like it with just a tiny bit of sweetener and a wedge of lemon.  That being said, to get the amount and strength I like for my tea I have to use 2 k-cups for one cup of tea.  I usually do two 6 oz brews and it is just right.  I can go up to an 8 oz brew and still have good flavor but I want more than 8oz at a time.  For me it is just too expensive to use 2 k-cups at a time.  I have compromised with myself and still keep the k-cups around to use if I am in a hurry (or just extra lazy) but I mostly just use the tea bags of the same flavor.  I find it really isn't much more difficult or time consuming to use my keurig machine for hot water to steep a tea bag in.  The tea bags are just much more economical for me.	3	0
		A3VBXQKRM7A4JR	Keep it simple	"Just to keep it simple...more of a comparison than a total review.  I love jalapeno chips - look mostly for the level of spice, then pepper flavor, good crunch, and not loaded down with salt.<br /><br />With that said, these Deep River Snacks chips (jalapeno flavor) are:<br />1. Better than the Lays Jalapeno.  (Deep RIver have the same spice level, which is lacking.  Neither have a lot of pepper flavor.)<br />2. About the same as the jalapeno chips that the ""World Market"" branded chips.  (World Market has a little more spice, but also a lot more salt.)<br />3. Not nearly as good as Tim's Cascade Jalapeno chips.  (Tims has more pepper flavor, more spice, a little bit better crunch...but also have MSG.)<br /><br />It's not to say these chips are bad, but just what the 3-stars says ""It's OK.""  There are better, there are worse...to me, these are right in the middle of the pack."	0	0
		A1YKXVGAIA8952	Fruity	A nice blend of several different fruits. This stage 3 food was tasty. Not as thick as some other stage threes and there are no bites or chunks. It is more like a thin custard. My son always loved this.	0	0

		AO3NYE4KMHME4	Its not as GREAT as the resturant version, but its still good	I had ordered a case of this incredible soup, based on my experience of ordering it at the the Dallas Fort Worth resturant. It was so incredible that I ordered another container to go, couldnt stop thinking about it during my meeting in Dallas and ordered two more before my flight back to California. I went out of my way to go to this terminal so I could order it again.<br /><br />So when I got the canned version....not as impressed. Oh well.	2	1

		AY9Q2GOI9BZD2	Zuke's Lamb Jerky Treats:  2 paws up!	"The Lamb Jerky soft treats are the first product we tried from Zuke's.  They were a big hit and continue to be one of my little schnoodle's favorite treats.<br />Soft jerky squares (approx 1"") can easily be split into 3-4 pieces.  We use them for her training/play sessions and she seems to especially love it when the reward is the Zuke's soft lamb jerky.<br />Although she performs just as eagerly when the reward is the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00292BM7C"">Zuke's 16-Ounce Mini Bakes Dog Treats, Peanut Butter n' Blueberryz</a> or the Zuke's Mini Bakes Chicken n' Cherry.

		A1KPNQ8KI22ZX4	Raw tangy, cooked tasteless	"Disclaimer: I have this on subscribe-and-save.<br /><br />I make yogurt with raw milk and this product, when I don't have any yogurt lying around it makes for a very tangy yogurt that is fairly runny. (Milk heated to 110F and incubated at same for 12 hours.)<br /><br />If I ""cook"" the milk to 180F (then cool to 110F before adding this) then it makes for a very firm yogurt that is bland.<br /><br />So, if I had to make a recommendation, it would be to buy this if you're wanting bland yogurt that will be mixed with various fruits. Otherwise just use a dollop of an otherwise edible yogurt as a starter and chance the result.<br /><br />It does contain sucrose so if you're attempting to be paleo/primal you will need to weigh up whether that's acceptable or not.<br /><br />Bland and firm vs runny and tangy. Your choice."	1	0
		AHSURYHM6ZZXC	Tasty hot sauce!	This is my favorite hot sauce. I buy it locally and love the flavor that they all have. Hopefully the other flavors will show up on amazon for people to enjoy!

		A9S4SKY3QB81H	Best Instant I've ever tasted but nevertheless it is still instant. Check Best by date.	Prepared as directed w/ 8oz of water it is very strong good tasting coffee, not better than fresh Colombian, but very good for emergencies and to have on hand.  For some this might be strong so 10oz of water is more the kind my friends like. A good Colombian coffee on the go but I like my fresh ground and brewed stuff better. I give them an A for effort, finally someone is getting close to that point where I can't tell it isn't fresh brewed but not quite there yet. I ordered it 2 days ago and got it fast, the best by date on mine is May 20th of this year 2011, rather quick to expire or this stock is old? Perhaps that is why it tastes instant?	0	0
		AYGJ96W5KQMUJ	Really Good - Can't Tell the Difference	"The only difference I can see between using this blend and using brown sugar is that you don't get the usual ""sugar rush"" when you eat the result.  Cookies and pies made with this Splenda blend - which does contain some sugar - taste the exactly the same as they did before.  Great stuff!  And it's gluten-free too."	4	0
		ATNQNZEHWMR9U	Pricey but nice selection of salts	I bought this as a gift for a friend who likes exotic salts, and it was a hit with him. It was well packaged with no breakage. (Some of the reviews have mentioned that they received broken containers.) The wooden holder is nice but not all that permanent. I would recommend this for someone who'd like to sample various kinds of salt and doesn't mind paying a high price. The reason I gave it four and not five stars was the price.	1	1
		A3VBBRHETBOP3Y	Great Stuff	I used it for a sinus infection where I lost my voice completely and had a sore throat. I found this product on yelp and went to an herbal Asian store in Chinatown in Phila. I only paid $2.50! the only difference is that I didn't get tea bags they were dissoluble cubes you place in the hot water. It worked great. It took a few hours to work but it worked!. The next day I had my voice back completely and no sore throat. One night I woke up from terrible post nasal drip cough, took a cup of this tea and it eliminated the cough and put me right to sleep. A must buy, its cheap and natural. You cant go wrong if you give it a try.	1	0
		A2T1NDDE2Z2OAK	great taste now in a 100 calorie bag	I love popchips, The bag now has only 100 calories. and it bit smaller but If you are craving pop chips without the fat and still taste great. These are for you. A bit pricey but worth it.	0	0
		A14X244VGHWPSX	Not bad..	I've now tried several of the Switch drinks. They're not bad, for a carbonated juice drink, especially. This, actually, was one of the better flavors I've tried. It's got a nice orange juice type flavor that I enjoyed. Ultimately, these drinks remind me of Apple Beer, which is essentially carbonated apple juice. I love that drink, and think Switch could try an apple version of their product. I'm sure I'd love it as well...<br /><br />That being said, give it a try. It will quench your thirst, and I'm sure it'll do well in the marketplace. It fills a void where very few drink manufacturers have entered.	0	0
		A286C5PALVXN5R	Heavily Flavored - Not For Us	I thought this was a Jamaican blend or roast, but turns out it's simply a heavily flavored coffee.  The flavor tastes artificial - like fake maple syrup flavoring.  We have three coffee drinkers in our house and none of us could get past the first few sips.  Now I have to find a home for the rest of it so it doesn't go to waste.	2	1

		A1RAC4U8SU87NW	great idea but...	I was dissapointed in this one. The only way to get the treats out is to tug it on the ground but the rope encourages the dog to carry it around, throw it around etc... You have to fill it up to get the treats to come out and sorry but I don't want to give my dog 2 days worth of food. Maybe I would have been better off buying the smaller one.	0	0
		AYSYN1KLL6W5D	Delicious	Before I say anything else, I am mindful of differing tastes, as well as differences in processing from one batch of coffee to another. That said, I found the Coffee Bean Direct Hazelnut coffee to be evenly roasted (medium) and bearing a robust and rich hazelnut flavor from the first to the last cup. Since this is my first bag of hazelnut coffee from CBD, with which I am very pleased, I will update my comments, specifically addressing the consistency of the roasting/flavoring process from batch to batch with my next purchase. If my other CBD purchases are any indication, I anticipate a consistent product.	0	0
		ADR4ULYSJERNR	McCanns steel cut oatmeal	Purchased case of 6 cans from Amazon.com for [...]  bucks including shipping.<br />Good quality slow cooking oatmeal. Good shelf life on cans. This is the slow cooking type 20-40 minutes depending on preference. Taste is good.	1	0
		A7O427ARFVJYQ	Holy Pepper!	I've tried a couple of other flavors of this brand and they were great, however, this pepper flavor was over the top. Way too much pepper for my taste. So much so that I couldn't eat more than a couple of pieces and I don't plan on eating any more of it.	0	0

		A1KIT78G85X3WH	The worst coconut water I've ever tasted	I have tried many brands of coconut water, including some flavored ones, but this one does not merit even one star.  It does not taste at all like coconut water --- WAY too much sugar and flavorings added --- sickeningly sweet. Very disappointing and truly a waste of my money.  Same was true of the passionfruit flavor. Yuck.	4	3
		A34QHHKRKHXZOB	not really	I was really hoping this would be good.  Unfortunately it is not. Overall, the nutritional composition of peanuts is extremely good, with most of the peanut's fat being monounsaturated. They also provide an excellent source of protein, vitamin E, and fiber. So make your own peanut butter, or just buy the natural with no additives.	4	6
		A2IK9R2M2OVR6J	Good Deal	My husband is a big coffee drinker, and with a deal like this I can order ahead and never have to worry about running out. I hate to have to run to the store because I am out of one thing.	1	2
		A3OBT30URCJEW2	the boys who eat everything won't eat it!	Very surprised.  Expected it to be thicker.  My 8 month olds are not pickey eaters but they refused to close thier mouths while this food was is there.  I would try it from babies r us before buying in bulk here.	2	1
		A281NPSIMI1C2R	Also look for the packets	If you are looking for a sweetener that is delicious in tea, Stevia can be used to sweeten hot or cold tea. You can almost say goodbye to regular sugars in your drinks once you get a taste for the Stevia powder.<br /><br />Unlike artificial sweeteners, Stevia is never bitter and won't leave a nasty aftertaste in your mouth. The packets are easy to carry with you and you may even notice you have less cravings for sugary foods.<br /><br />By using a low calorie (0 Calories) sweetener with only 1 gram of carbs, you will be ahead of the game. Every single time you use one packet of Stevia, you are using less sugar and you won't even miss it.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	1	0
		A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ	Good coffee, but lets clear up the flavors?	I saw the good reviews of this Jamaica Me Crazy coffee, but the reviewers all seem to wander around whether it has coconut, vanilla, caramel, rum or coffee liqueur flavorings.<br /><br />First off, I'm not getting any coconut from it at all.  Some vanilla, but it mostly tastes like coffee with baileys irish cream in it.<br /><br />In fact, after I drank a cup I had to go pick up my son from kindergarten and it occurred to me that some of the other parents might think I was drinking spiked coffee while we waited for the class to let out! :)<br /><br />But its good.  I recommend it to anyone who likes flavored coffee.  Not really anything else like it and I've tried about 20 different k-cup flavors.	1	0

"Despite several washings, I can not get rid of the industrial plastic smell on the soft rubber parts of this toy, and our dog (lab mix) has absolutley no interest in it, despite favorite treats inside. I can only assume she finds the smell offensive/repellant.<br /><br />If she does ever take an interest in it (I keep trying), I will keep a close eye on the rubber ""rope""- seems like something she may chew through fairly quickly."	1	1

		A3VD6KREW99X02	Extremely mild, good spice level for kids	Got the Spicy Chicken from the grocery store. It was sitting right there, buried by Top Ramen and Maruchan. I wanted the Shin Noodle but was not there. The positive notes about this noodle bowl; Not too salty and the broth is worth drinking at the end. Cons; The noodles aren't that different from those other brands. For more then 3x the price, i was expecting better noodles. Also it's really not that spicy. Extremely mild, good spice level for kids.	0	0

		A1KRDVD1TJUQ92	DO NOT feed your cat Fussie Cat foods!!!	My oldest cat has become very finicky about his food, and I need him to gain some weight, so I decided to try a new food.  Fussie Cat gave him diarrhea, which I attributed to switching to a new food, but it lasted for the three weeks I fed it to him, and his fur became duller.  Every time my other two cats got into this food, they vomited, which they generally do not do.  My oldest cat just got a checkup.  He now has renal failure.  His numbers were 100% fine just a few months ago.  I can only attribute it to this food.  I believe he has acute renal failure due to some toxin from Fussie Cat.  Fussie Cat is from Thailand-- there are ZERO regulations for pet food there, and can write whatever they feel like on the can.  My vet, when he saw the food, told me to get my cat off of it, and said other clients of his had had bad reactions to this food.<br /><br />If you value your pet's health, stay far, far away from Fussie Cat.  I have my cat on Merrick now, and he is doing better.  I can only hope I can reverse the damage this food has done.	3	4

		A2K7OLKHLJ0YSE	Makes strong Tea	This tea makes extremely dark and strong tea on the 11oz setting which is my largest water capacity setting. I use the Keurig Iced Beverage Tumblers filled with ice and can't drink it straight.  My solution is to fill a gallon pitcher with ice, add some water, make two iced brew K-cups and pour it over the ice water for what I consider perfect iced tea.  You can forego the water for stronger tea, or add more water to dilute the tea depending on your mood or tastes.  This tea has excellent flavor, it's just too strong right out of the Keurig for my tastes and in my opinion requires diluting.  Excellent for making a pitcher of tea!	3	0
		A3TK2IOP8UQ087	Lightly Salted, Heavily Delicious!	These are the best potato chips that money can buy.  There is just enough salt to taste it, but not so much that it masks the lingering potatoey awesomeness after you've wolfed down a bag of these beauties.  Each chip has the perfect thickness - my teeth get excited every time I put one in my mouth!  Everything about these chips is so perfect, it's like they were made by God and delivered by Gabriel himself.  Now that I know Amazon carries these, I don't even have to leave my house to buy them!  I may never eat anything else again!	0	1

		A14CKU93LLXPTV	Delish smoked cheese I will buy over and over again!	For serious goat cheese lovers, this is a step up from the French goat cheese that you can buy at the grocery store. I had never had smoked goat cheese before and this was a revelation: the creamy, smooth, a little sour taste went fabulously well with the smoke flavor. I used it sprinkled over a tomato, bean and romaine salad and also spread on toast points topped with an apple-zucchini relish from the 101 cookbooks blog. Outstanding artisan cheese that I look forward to enjoying again.	1	0

		A1HRECPV2Q79BG	Amazing (even if it is trendy)	I admit that I fully expected to dislike this product, and approached it with a dismissive attitude - something that's this trendy can't be any good, right? well, I was wrong. The ONE coconut water is refreshing, delicious, and just barely sweet. Really wonderful stuff. The hint of pineapple adds a little bit of acidity that enhances the basic taste of the water. i bet this would make a great summer drink too, but I only had one so I didn't get tot try that. My problem now is that it's been out of stock, so I can't get more.	1	0
		A35U4HGXY7OOCX	Kept her interest, then she destroyed it	My dog really enjoyed this. she spent hours trying to get the treats out. but in the first 10 minutes she chewed the plastic 'rope' in half out of frustration. So now the toy doesn't work as intended, but still i put her dog food in there since i know she'll be able to get it out pretty easily, it will just take more work than the bowl. This is a really great toy, just wish the rope would have lasted a day. so be sure to supervise play before you leave your dog with this one.	2	0

		A2MXME0QLYZB67	"The ""rope"" is actually rubber. Chewed through it in seconds."	The rope part of the toy that the dog is supposed to tug on to get the treats out is rubber and not rope as shown in the product pocture. My 45lb border collie mix chewed through that in almost record time.<br /><br />He really likes the toy. He just picks it up now by the knobby top and drops it to get the treats out. I will probably try to put an actual rope and stopper in to fix it. I am just disappointed that it wasn't as shown.	0	0

		A3CN2OVKRVSFSF	Morkie cannot get any treats out when used as intended.	I bought 3 doggy products at the same time (all treat dispensing chew toys). This is my recommendation of the best product of the 3.<br /><br />I bought the Premier Twist and Treat Dog Toy along with a KONG classic and Premier Tug a Jug for my 3 month old, 4lb Morkie. My dog doesn't play with the latter 2, but LOVES the twist and treat! It's easy to twist the top off and insert the treats and to twist it down to the size you want to get it to dispense. Smoothie quickly learned how to dispense the treats, so we have it on its tightest setting (puppy chow is pretty small, so easy to get out). He chases and bats this all over the living room.<br /><br />He played with the classic Kong once, but because it dispenses the treats so quickly, he soon lost interest and went back to the twist and treat.<br /><br />He tries to play with the Tug a Jug, but he can never get anything out and quickly tires of it and goes back to the twist and treat.<br /><br />Of the 3, the twist and treat gets the most use, its the easiest to clean, is hardy, has the best movement for him to chase around, & is the perfect size for a toy dog.<br /><br />So, if you're looking to keep your dog entertained, don't waste money buying a bunch of products, just get the twist and treat. Both you and your pup will be pleased with it.<br /><br />21 March 2012 Update<br /><br />I have since removed the back end of the jug and my dog will now play with it, in fact he expects for me to put all his food in it so he can chase it around and dig them out with his paws and nose. That said, this is the only way for him to use the jug, so still not fulfilling its intended purpose or use. Cleaning if course is a pain.	0	0
		A3L5YMME3V8U9P	my 3 cats won't eat it	I was really hoping this grain free canned cat food will work for my 3 cats; looks like it has good ingredients but none of my 3 cats will eat it. In fact one of them will smell it and start doing the scratching thing like he smells poop. Another weird thing is the whole can is kind of soft and meshed like baby food but there are some whole green peas in it, not sure if that is by design or some green peas escape the meshing.	1	1

Trying to find tasty snacks that don't contain these products is not easy so we were thrilled to find Mrs. Mays Naturals.  We love the Cashew Crunch as well!	7	1
		A18N0CLOB4HZYL	No evidence	Puzzled as to why this product doesn't live up to the claims? You're not the only one. There does not appear to be any evidence at all to support the claims made. One has to wonder if the testimonials are indeed genuine, given the lack of evidence.	1	4

		A21ACKP1NWDCDJ	Candy good, reaction bad	Well, I love hard candies, but not the sugar. My husband & I saw these and thought we'd found the perfect solution. Unfortunately, the candies -- while very tasty -- played havoc with our systems. We couldn't eat more than 8 at one time (5 for me) without getting crampy & gaseous. At first we didn't realize it was the candies causing the effect, but that changed quickly. We had to discard the rest of the product. What a shame.	0	0
		A2PGYO72VN5OB2	stopped doggie accidents	I bought this product because my dogs were having accidents in the laundry room overnight.  I'm not sure how or why this works...but it stopped them from peeing.  The dogs love em too.	1	0
		AHRASE2UFPFKK	Makes you feel like you are having breakfast in bed.	Have enjoyed every single cup of Breakfast in Bed. Just the right kind of brew to wake up these old bones and get me started on the day's adventure. Also enjoy it while watching NCIS so I can join Gibbs enjoying a brew as well.	0	0
		A2DPXEK3B5ZOSG	What am I missing?	Everyone seems to enjoy these so I think maybe I'm missing something.  I microwaved them for slightly less time than instructed and only about 1/5 of them changed consistency from the little flat parallelograms to a slightly puffier flat paralleogram.  Next batch I did a little longer and a couple more of them puffed up a little bit.  Even the puffy ones seem to have patches of tremendously hardened pork(don't laugh) in them to a point where when you eat one and there are pork rind shards that break away from the puffy.  I tried one last time and microwaved them for a minute and a half longer than instructed and this time the puffy ones overcooked and burned and the others stayed in tiny, hard form(again, don't laugh).<br /><br />If anyone that orders these and learns any tips that I might be missing, please let me know. They will be in their resealable package in the pantry until that point or they expire.<br /><br />Thanks.	4	1
		A1KDI64D7RK3D1	Popchips Satisfy my Salt and Crunch Craving	I'm trying to eat healthier and one of the things I really love is chips and salty snacks of all kinds!  These Popchips really do the trick of satisfying my craving. Though I don't really care for the pepper flavor, I like all of the others.  I will buy these again.	0	0
		ARLTWKV2AUJ2F	Very Tasty - BUT BEWARE	"Long story short - these are very tasty. We have purchased a number of flavors from this brand, this is my favorite.<br /><br />BUT... as noted by another reviewer - these contain MSG in the form of ""Yeast Extract"".<br /><br />It has become a popular means of hiding MSG lately by calling it different things, as a person who now finds himself having to use more caution in what I consume I find the whole process of hiding in plain site very bothersome.<br /><br />Also, the bag is not very large, but half of it is air. This may well help in shipping, but when paying a premium price for 'organic' it just seems more deceptive."	1	3
		A31MZR41SM9JU5	Too SOUR!	I love sour food but this one I can't bear.  Too strong sour taste... and even when you open the bag, the sour smell is too strong.  I don't like it.	1	6
		A31YSTICHFYN7O	Low Acid, Low Taste	I got this as a gift for my girlfriend's mother who had mentioned getting heart burn from coffee - even though she loves coffee.  I thought this might make a reasonable fix to the situation.  After trying though she seemed to be a little less worried with the heart burn and little more concerned with the taste.  She didn't have heartburn, but she also didn't drink very much either - due to taste.  She thought it tasted a little stale and bland.  Maybe it was just a bad batch, but seems the process to limit the acid also limits the flavor.  Too bad, I had hoped this was going to be a big winner.	0	0
